It took me a long time to write this review, because I finished this book right as Trump was reÃ«lected and I found the confluence of events too painful.  
  
In the book, a very plausible right-wing party takes over Ireland with disastrous results. It's a good book, but it's a bit like reading the book of Job - you ask yourself what will the main character have to endure _next_.  
  
It's well-written, painful, and I'll never read it again.
