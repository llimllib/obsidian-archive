I bought this at the Strand last summer because a long time ago I read and loved [The City & The City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_%26_the_City), and finally got around to finishing it.

It has a reasonably high cheese factor, with a long setup of the world followed by a turn into a sci-fi-fantasy action plot, followed by a weird ending with a bit of a morality play.

The book had enough interesting ideas and characters that it was worth it to me, though it felt a bit splintered overall. I enjoyed it well enough, but it's not an all-time favorite for me.
