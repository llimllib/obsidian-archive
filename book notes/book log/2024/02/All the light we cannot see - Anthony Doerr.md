I had a long flight coming up, and I knew I was going to finish [[Perdido Street Station - China Mi√©ville]], so I bought the only decent-looking book in an airport newsstand: "All the light we cannot see", by Anthony Doerr. 

(Unfortunately my copy came with this ugly netflix ad cover rather than [the more attractive original cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RBTG28sCL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg), which still honestly isn't great but is better)

I absolutely loved the book. It reminded me of [Pachinko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko_(novel)), but set in the west rather than the east. The fast switching of perspectives gave the thing a really pleasing rhythm, and the end was suitably heartbreaking.
