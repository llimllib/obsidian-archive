> This site is home to the documentation for the SQLite project's WebAssembly- and JavaScript-related APIs. These components will be released for public beta with version 3.40 and tentatively made API-stable with the 3.41 release, pending community feedback. Unlike the [core sqlite3 documentation](https://sqlite.org/docs.html), this site is primarily made up of markdown-formatted content stored in a [Fossil SCM](https://fossil-scm.org/home) code repository and rendered to HTML on demand. This means, for example, that the documentation seen here is updated automatically as edits are checked in by developers.
