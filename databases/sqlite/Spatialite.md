> SpatiaLite is an **open source** library intended to extend the [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) core to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
>  Using SQLite + SpatiaLite you can effectively deploy an alternative _open source_ Spatial DBMS roughly equivalent to [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) + [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/).

Here's a demo project of using it with [[Datasette]]
