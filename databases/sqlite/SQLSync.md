> **SQLSync is a collaborative offline-first wrapper around SQLite** designed to synchronize web application state between users, devices, and the edge.

> **Example use cases**

> - A web app with a structured file oriented data model like Figma. Each file could be a SQLSync database, enabling real-time local first collaboration and presence
> - Running SQLSync on the edge with high tolerance for unreliable network conditions
> - Enabling optimistic mutations on SQLite read replicas
