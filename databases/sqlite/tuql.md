> **tuql** is a simple tool that turns a sanely formatted sqlite database into a graphql endpoint. It tries to infer relationships between objects, currently supporting `belongsTo`, `hasMany` and `belongsToMany`. It also forms the basic mutations necessary to create, update, and delete objects, as well as assoicate many-to-many relationships.
