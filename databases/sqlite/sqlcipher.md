> SQLCipher is a standalone fork of SQLite that adds 256 bit AES encryption of database files and other security features.

"open source" but available with a commercial license that has all the features and says it's 3-4x faster. Why would I use the OSS version if I have to accept that slowdown?

Looks like neat software, but not likely I'd pay for it.
