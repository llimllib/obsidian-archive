Alex Garcia, author of [[sqlite-vec]], gives an example of how you might pair sqlite FTS5 full-text search with sqlite-vec to get augmented search that doesn't suck.

I really like his example of HBO's semantic search returning the TV series "Adventure Time" as the 10th result on a search for... "Adventure Time" to demonstrate why you might not want to use just semantic search.
