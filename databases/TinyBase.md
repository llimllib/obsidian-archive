> ## The _reactive_ data store for local‑first apps.

> Modern apps deserve better. Why trade reactive user experiences to be able to use relational data? Why sacrifice store features for bundle size? And why should the cloud do all the work [anyway](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)?

> _TinyBase is a smart new way to structure your local app data:_

> -   Familiar concepts of [tables, rows, and cells](https://tinybase.org/#set-and-get-tables-rows-and-cells), and [schematization](https://tinybase.org/#apply-schemas-to-tables) to model your data domain.
> -   [Flexibly reactive](https://tinybase.org/#register-listeners-at-any-granularity) to reconciled updates, so your UI only spends cycles on the data that changes.
> -   _NEW!_ [Powerful query engine](https://tinybase.org/#build-complex-queries-with-tinyql) to select, join, filter, group, sort and paginate data - reactively.
> -   [Indexing](https://tinybase.org/#create-indexes-for-fast-lookups), [metrics](https://tinybase.org/#define-metrics-and-aggregations), [relationships](https://tinybase.org/#configure-relationships-between-tables) - and even an [undo stack](https://tinybase.org/#use-checkpoints-for-an-easy-undo-stack) for your app state! - out of the box.
> -   Easily [sync your data](https://tinybase.org/#persist-data-to-browser-file-or-server) to local or remote storage, and use [idiomatic bindings](https://tinybase.org/#call-hooks-to-bind-to-data) to your UI.
