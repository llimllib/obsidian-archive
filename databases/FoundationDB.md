-   **Multi-model data store.** FoundationDB is multi-model, meaning you can store many types data in a single database. All data is safely stored, distributed, and replicated in the Key-Value Store component.
-   **Easily scalable and fault tolerant.** FoundationDB is easy to install, grow, and manage. It has a distributed architecture that gracefully scales out, and handles faults while acting like a single ACID database.
-   **Industry-leading performance.** FoundationDB provides amazing performance on commodity hardware, allowing you to support very heavy loads at low cost.
-   **Ready for production.** FoundationDB has been running in production for years and been hardened with lessons learned. Backing FoundationDB up is an unmatched testing system based on a deterministic simulation engine.
-   **Open source.** We encourage your participation in our open source community!
