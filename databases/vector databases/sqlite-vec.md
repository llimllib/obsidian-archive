https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec

> An extremely small, "fast enough" vector search SQLite extension that runs anywhere! A successor to [[sqlite-vss]]

> - Store and query float, int8, and binary vectors in `vec0` virtual tables
> - Written in pure C, no dependencies, runs anywhere SQLite runs (Linux/MacOS/Windows, in the browser with WASM, Raspberry Pis, etc.)
> - Pre-filter vectors with `rowid IN (...)` subqueries
