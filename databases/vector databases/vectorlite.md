A sqlite extension wrapping [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) for vector search.

I asked the author how it compared to [[sqlite-vss]], and [they responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/sqlite/comments/1dznc2z/vectorlite_a_fast_vector_search_extension_for/lcieirb/) that hnswlib seems to be quite a bit faster than faiss and also works on windows, which faiss does not.
