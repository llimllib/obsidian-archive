> Rill Developer is a tool that makes it effortless to transform your datasets with SQL. It's not just a SQL GUI! Rill Developer follows a few guiding principles:

-   _no more data analysis "side-quests"_ – helps you build intuition about your dataset through automatic profiling
-   _no "run query" button required_ – responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset
-   _works with your local datasets_ – imports and exports Parquet and CSV
-   _feels good to use_ – powered by Sveltekit & DuckDB = conversation-fast, not wait-ten-seconds-for-result-set fast
