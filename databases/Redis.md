in-memory data structure server

Redis recently (March 2024) removed the BSD license and is no longer open source software.

Some open source forks of it include:

- [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/)
	- performance-focused multithreaded redis
- [redict](https://codeberg.org/redict/redict)
	- by Drew DeVault et al, this branch will attempt to stay closer to redis, rename everything to `redict`
	- [blog post announcement](https://redict.io/posts/2024-03-22-redict-is-an-independent-fork/)
