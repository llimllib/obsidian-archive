via [Miska Knapek](https://bsky.app/profile/miskaknapek.bsky.social/post/3leyh5fjp422b) on bluesky, notes that overture has added a feature where you can download the OSM data shown on the page:

It's limited to zoom level 15 or greater, so it doesn't work for a bulk download, but if you need the data for a small area quickly it's very easy to get.
