Armin Ronacher describes how and when they use AI.

I particularly like how they describe the use of the ChatGPT's voice chat as a pair programming partner and with their children.

> AI tools, at their best, feel less like disruptive and dark magic and more like a natural extension of the creative process as long as you see them as curious collaborators. My approach isn't about outsourcing thinking, but augmenting it: using LLMs to accelerate grunt work, untangle mental knots, and prototype ideas faster. Skepticism is healthy, but dismissing AI outright risks missing its potential as a multiplier for those willing to engage critically.
