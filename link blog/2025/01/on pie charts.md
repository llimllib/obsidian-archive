> there are countless debates about pie charts. Most arguments focus on perceptual precision: itâ€™s easier to compare positions (as in a bar chart) than angles (as in a pie chart). Research shows that people can estimate values more accurately with an unlabeled bar chart than a pie chart. Early data viz pioneers used this to declare, "Pie charts should never be used." But that ignores the fact that pie charts are better at other things, like showing that all data adds up to 100% at a glance and showing part-to-whole comparisons.
