David Crawshaw writes up how he uses LLMs.

His feelings on "chat-driven programming" match my own experiences - I don't want them in the UI at all, though I use [[llm]] instead of a web UI.

My main disagreement is that I have no desire whatever for autocomplete, which he loves.

Anyway, interesting post to read from such a high quality engineer.
