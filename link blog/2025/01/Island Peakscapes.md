Lovely shaded relief maps of a few islands, styled after [Chaney Swiney's Peakscapes](https://chaneyswiney.com/cartography#:~:text=finding%20the%20time.-,peakscapes,-Iconic%20mountain%20skylines) project, though using a different method (Blender).

I had meant to link Peakscapes earlier, so I'm glad I found another reference to it, the images are lovely:

I liked it so much I did a brief look at generating my own for my home range of the White Mountains, but didn't get very far.
