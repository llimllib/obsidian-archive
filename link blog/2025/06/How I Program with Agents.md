> Let me talk you through an example of where I used an agent to do a significant amount of work on a project. I implemented the first pass of Github App auth for the hosted sketch.dev using sketch. It did the whole thing with 3-4 pieces of feedback as I clicked around the interface finding errors. That is an astonishing achievement. It is easy for the haughty to disregard the work of gluing well-known APIs together as “not real” programming, but it has been the practical experience of my career that for every hour of truly interesting programming I can do, I have had to do 10 or more hours of dreary work with APIs, libraries, dysfunctional compilers, build systems, or obtuse package managers to actually make that hour useful. Having a tool that lets me do 30 minutes of “not real” programming by writing a few carefully constructed sentences, and lets me vacuum the kids' room while it works, **preserves momentum**.
