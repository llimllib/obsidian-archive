> Here’s an example. One of the authors worked on a software team that tracked its work with index cards taped to a wall. The team would constantly evolve the tracker—tape lines moved; checklists appeared; special zones of cards emerged around the main grid. The fluidity of the tool encouraged fluidity of process.

> Later, the team switched to a web-based issue tracker to support remote collaborators. Now there wasn’t a way to model or display a special zone of cards, so the team abandoned that part of their process. Further process changes also ground to a halt. Before, new ideas took minutes to try; now they could take hours of wrangling configurations, if they were possible at all. **Computerizing work led to a loss of agency.**

> The history of free software offers lessons on how sociotechnical systems like this can be constructed. We are especially inspired by situations where free-software communities don’t assume there should only be one centrally-controlled version of an application in the world. For instance, Mastodon instances run by small communities often [edit Mastodon’s code](https://runyourown.social/) to implement community-specific features and policies. Of course, situations like this still require serious engineering work, and are still operating on apps. As we move towards a world with gentler slopes into software modification, and more tools rather than apps, we’ll need to figure out how smaller pieces of code can be shared and collaboratively developed, and how interoperability can be maintained in a world of pluralistic software.
