Nice video about a very cool result drastically lowering the space bound for programs run on multi-tape turing machines.

I often like to read the quanta articles for results like this, and this one [is good as well](https://www.quantamagazine.org/for-algorithms-a-little-memory-outweighs-a-lot-of-time-20250521/)

The actual paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17779), `Simulating Time with Square-Root Space`, and builds on the work by [Cook and Mertz](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/174/) in `Tree Evaluation is in Space O(log n Â· log log n)`

via [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/an5g0c/astonishing_discovery_by_computer), a place I wouldn't expect to usually hear about results in computation, a field I used to follow but no longer really keep up on at all.
