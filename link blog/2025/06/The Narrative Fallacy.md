> The problem with narratives is that they make everything sound convincing _even if they really shouldn’t_. The problem with this result is _blindingly_ obvious – a twelve year old would object to your victory under this ruleset, and the objection would be sustained. But we stick a little story on here – “The ridiculous result makes sense _**because**…”_ and suddenly it gets past intelligent people.

> Narratives are indiscriminate. Attach them to _anything_ and they are now more compelling.
