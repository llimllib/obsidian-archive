I love this idea for a sidecar to Apple's documentation website with community notes and code samples.

I'm not an Apple developer, so I don't have direct usage for it, but
- Apple's documentation is particularly, amazingly, bad
- All code documentation should have examples, they're incredibly undersold as documentation
- I wish there were a more general form of this, where people shared notes on websites

In that vein, I also saw the [extension-annotation-sidebar](https://github.com/hzoo/extension-annotation-sidebar) from [@henryzoo.com](https://bsky.app/profile/henryzoo.com) that puts a bluesky sidebar on your browser, and shows all bluesky comments that mention a particular webpage and lets you respond to them.
