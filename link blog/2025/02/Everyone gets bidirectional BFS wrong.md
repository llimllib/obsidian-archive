Wonderful article that starts with a description of the algorithm and [[Interactive explainer]]s, then shows how most people get it wrong, and finally delves into the history of why almost every online source gets it wrong.

Ends by showing that LLMs happily plagiarize the subtly-incorrect version, so that if you trust an LLM to write it for you, you'll get it wrong.
