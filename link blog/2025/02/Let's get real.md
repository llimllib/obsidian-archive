> Nor do I think Trump is a carbon copy of Mussolini or Hitler or his regime will fully resemble theirs. I don’t think this is as virulent an instantiation. But there is much more to the comparison than has been allowed by otherwise smart and well-read people who just sneer at it. To the critics of the fascism thesis, I’d just quote Oliver Cromwell, “I beseech you…think it possible that you may be mistaken.”

A thorough and interesting examination of the state of Trump's attempt to consolidate executive power through the lens of other fascist movements.

Pairs well with [[Ur-fascism]], which I just re-re-read and continue to get something new from every time I do.
