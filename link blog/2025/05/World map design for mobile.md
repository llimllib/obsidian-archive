> Most world maps you see online are not really designed for mobile screens. They're too small and require interaction to see countries like Switzerland. At NZZ, we wondered if we could come up with a design that works better. In a large user study, we showed that our redesigned world map improves readability â€“ especially for small countries. We also found that using bubbles sized according to population, rather than land area, led to interpretations that more accurately reflected the underlying data.
