> The story so far: back in the early two-thousands Christian Bök... started work on the world’s first biologically-self-replicating poem: the _Xenotext Experiment_, which aspired to encode a poem into the genetic code of a bacterium

> Phase One involved engineering Orpheus and Eurydice into the benign and ubiquitous _E. coli_, just to work out the bugs. Ultimately, though, the target microbe was _Deinococcus radiodurans_: also known as “Conan the Bacterium” on account of being one of the toughest microbial motherfuckers on the planet...

> Because now it’s 2025, and he fucking _did it_. The Xenotext is live and glowing in _Deinococcus radiodurans_: iterating away inside that immortal microbial bad-ass that _feeds on stainless steel_, that _resides inside the core of reactor no. 4 at Chernobyl_, that _does not die in the explosion that disintegrates the Space Shuttle Columbia during orbital reentry_.
