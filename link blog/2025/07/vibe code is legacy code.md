> Programming is fundamentally [_theory building_](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf), not producing lines of code. We know this. This is why we make fun of business people who try to measure developer productivity in lines of code.

> When you vibe code, you are incurring tech debt as fast as the LLM can spit it out. Which is why vibe coding is _perfect_ for prototypes and throwaway projects: It's only legacy code if you have to maintain it!

- Steve Krouse

Sometimes it's OK to throw together an app that you don't or partially understand! But other times it's a terrible idea, and developers are terrible at estimating which is which.

Also [[Peter Naur|programming as theory building]] is becoming more well known, which makes me happy.
