Observable continues to try and figure out exactly what their product is.

There's a [neat demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeH6AhiQ4Bw&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fobservablehq.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) of using their new Mac desktop notebook editor. I'm surprised they're moving to a desktop app, and I'd love to know what drove it exactly!

The AI usage seems neat, and definitely like a hook to get people paying once they get used to it.

The also released a [notebook kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) for building static websites from a new [notebook format](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/kit). I assume this means that [framework](https://github.com/observablehq/framework) is de facto dead?
