> We have been in a centuries-long struggle against the externalities of technological progress. Inequity, social instability, and environmental degradation are awaiting resolution. In the case of safety, however, I believe the struggle has succeeded. Protocols have nearly eliminated fatal workplace accidents. We are at the end of the history of safety

Ryan linked the article (which is a worthwhile read in whole) because of this quote:

> These two statements are both true: _all accidents are preventable_ and _we cannot prevent all accidents._

English is a bit too flexible, allowing *all accidents* when what it really ought to be is *each accident*; I recommend the mental exercise of distinguishing the two when you can.
