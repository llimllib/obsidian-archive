> Now, for web browsers, compilers, formal methods, all of that, I am confident the knowledge is still worth teaching. I think these classes teach conceptually and practically-important topics, and the coding in those classes make students into better programmers.

> But for Web Dev I, I am not so sure. If there's anything the AIs are good at it's web development, and they're especially comfortable in the domain-knowledge-heavy world of crazy web APIs and languages. Do students really need to know how to write CSS? Yes, yes, but do they? I am no longer sure. That's not to say we shouldn't teach Web Dev I, but maybe the class should focus more on debugging tools? It should start students with a large code base to extend? We should move faster and get to Web Dev II topics in the first semester? I am not sure, but it's something I'll be thinking hard about over the summer.
