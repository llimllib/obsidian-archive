Russ Cox documents his design decisions around the experimental LLM bot he's building as a replacement for `gopherbot` on the golang github repository.

> We believe that there are a few good ideas for ways that LLM-based bots can help make project maintainers' jobs easier and less monotonous, and they are waiting to be found. There are also many bad ideas, and they must be filtered out. Understanding the difference will take significant care, thought, and experimentation. We have work to do.
