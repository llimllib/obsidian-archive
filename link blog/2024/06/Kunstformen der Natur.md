> **_Kunstformen der Natur_** (known in English as _**Art Forms in Nature**_) is a book of [lithographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography "Lithography") and [halftone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone "Halftone") prints by German biologist [Ernst Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel "Ernst Haeckel").

> Originally published in sets of ten between 1899 and 1904 and collectively in two volumes in 1904, it consists of 100 prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself. Over the course of his career, over 1000 prints were produced based on Haeckel's sketches and watercolors; many of the best of these were chosen for _Kunstformen der Natur_, translated from sketch to print by lithographer Adolf Giltsch.
