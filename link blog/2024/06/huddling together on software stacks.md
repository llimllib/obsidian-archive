Love this metaphor from Kartik:

> Trying to build software for others is extremely disheartening. I can be eating my own dogfood on a daily basis for years and still newcomers hit bugs in their first 10 minutes.
> 
> I wonder if this is the major reason to huddle together on top of jenga stacks with tons of dependencies, terrified of fragmentation: You always need more testing than you think, and there's no way to compete with something that's been through that much testing.

There's a lively discussion [following it](https://merveilles.town/@akkartik/112567862542495637) about... what the hell it is we're all doing here, people who write software, who use computers.

I like this quote [from Lu Wilson](https://mas.to/@TodePond/112568835448806961):

> right, there are two ways software can be durable. one is to never die. another is to be easily resurrectable, similar to [@dubroy](https://elk.zone/hachyderm.io/@dubroy)'s [cold-blooded software](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/)
