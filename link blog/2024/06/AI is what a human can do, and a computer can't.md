> Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term for those things a human brain can do, but a computer can't. When we find a way to do one of those things in the computer, it stops being AI.

- _unknown_, paraphrased by Charles Miller

> the combination of some truly amazing theoretical research and the availability of unprecedented amounts of computing power, gives us statistical models that can describe an image, or generate an image from a description. But they're not really intelligent.

> But _why_ are they not really intelligent?

> Because while they picked one, admittedly one of the larger, stones out of the big bucket labelled "things a brain can do but a computer can't", there's still all those other stones that remain...

> This is why AGI is so hard to define. It's _everything that remains in the bucket_.
