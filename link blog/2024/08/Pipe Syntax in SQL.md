I found this proposal interesting:

https://research.google/pubs/sql-has-problems-we-can-fix-them-pipe-syntax-in-sql/

(HTML veresion via [simonw](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/24/pipe-syntax-in-sql/)): [here](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/Pipe-Syntax-In-SQL.html)

It proposes adding a `|>` operator to SQL, which would allow authors to write it in a more natural way.

Richard Hipp [added it to SQLite](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5f218012b6e1a9db) as an experiment, but he wasn't impressed.
