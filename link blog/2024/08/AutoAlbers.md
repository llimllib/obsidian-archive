Neat interactive demo of color combinations; hit `n` for a new combination.

> This piece is a contemplative exploration of color and perception, inviting you to immerse yourself in the subtle art of visual interaction between colors. Over time, the generated shapes gradually coalesce into a monolithic form. Once complete, the composition gives way to a new visual experience, offering a continuous journey through evolving palettes.

> Inspired by the Albers effect—a phenomenon where the perception of a color is influenced by its surrounding hues—this project delves into the dynamic interplay of colors. Named after Josef Albers, the artist and educator who extensively studied color relationships in his seminal work _Interaction of Color_, this piece generates random palettes to explore sequential compositions. If your screen supports the Display-P3 color space, you will witness these colors in their most vibrant form.
