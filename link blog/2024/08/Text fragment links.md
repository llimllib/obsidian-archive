In a similar way to how you can link to an `id` attribute with an anchor link (`#id_name_here`), you can link to a particular snippet of text on the page:

`https://example.com/page.html#:~:text=text%20to%20link`

When a user goes to that link, it will open `page.html`, find `text to link`, and scroll to the first instance.

Very handy!

Supported already in Chrome, and Firefox and Safari support is coming shortly.
