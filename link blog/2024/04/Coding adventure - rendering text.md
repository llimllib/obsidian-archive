a 70-minute video where the author implements a fairly complete font shader from scratch in unity.

I'm particularly impressed with the author's facility with creating debugging shims to demonstrate the many floating-point precision problems they hit in their renderer. I so often spend a lot of time sitting and stewing than I would if I would just implement little shims to illustrate the problems like the author does.

Makes me want to learn how to make graphics with simple renderers and shaders.
