> I want a language for writing applications that is more expressive than Go but less complex than Rust.

> Go is simple and straightforward, but I often wish it offered more type safety. Rust is very nice to work with (at least for single threaded code) but it's too broad and complex, sometimes painfully so.

> **Borgo is a new language that transpiles to Go**. It's fully compatible with existing Go packages.
