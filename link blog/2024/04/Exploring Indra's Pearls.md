> I’m excited to be releasing an [interactive visualization using WebGPU](https://philogb.github.io/page/indraspearls/) of the fascinating math in the [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_Pearls_(book)) _“Indra’s Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein”_ by David Mumford, Caroline Series and David Wright.

> The book explores the patterns created by iterating [conformal maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map) of the complex plane called [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation), and their connections with symmetry and self-similarity. These patterns were glimpsed by German mathematician [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein), and modern computer graphics allows them to be fully visualized and explored in detail.

The post is a fun skim even though it went nearly-entirely over my head.

The interactive tool is chrome-only, as it uses [[WebGPU]]. I thought webGPU had rolled out farther than it seems to have done!
