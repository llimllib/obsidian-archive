> Writing code is much, much easier than reading code later and understanding it, still less spotting bugs in it. Spotting a bug is a challenge even when you know there is a bug: that’s what debugging is, and it’s hard. And when you prompt Copilot or Cody, and use the code it provides, code review is exactly what we are doing.
