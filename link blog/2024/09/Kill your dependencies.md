> Part of your job as a library author is to treat your user and their application with respect. You should make an effort to minimize your own dependencies so they don’t load unnecessary code or cause issues in the user’s application. You control your own code but you don’t control your dependencies. Any bug in a dependency of yours becomes a bug that causes stress for your user and their application.
