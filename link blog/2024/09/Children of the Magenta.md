Thought-provoking [mastodon thread]() from Dave Anderson on how automation failed pilots in the 90s, and how we may be making the same mistake again with software development:

> Today I'm thinking again about the "Children of the Magenta" lecture. In the late 90s, airlines realized that after going all-in on automation and flight assists in the 80s, they had trained a generation of automation-dependent pilots who were no longer capable of dealing with novel situations in which the automation couldn't help, or failed. Children of the magenta flight path line on the computer.

> I'm thinking about it because someone this morning bragged about letting LLMs write the code.

> The parallels are interesting. In the automation boom, airlines told pilots that in the future, they would not fly planes. They would be merely automation managers, providing high-level instruction to the computer, the actual pilot.

> In 1997, when the Children of the Magenta lecture was recorded, automation dependency was a significant factor in 68% of airline accidents.

> They didn't get rid of the automation, but they did go back to teaching pilots how to fly the planes, without the automation...

> The Children of the Magenta lecture: youtube.com/watch?v=WITLR_qSPX . The quality of the AV isn't great due to age and restoration, but the contents is _well_ worth it.

That's only some of it, I recommend reading the whole thing.
