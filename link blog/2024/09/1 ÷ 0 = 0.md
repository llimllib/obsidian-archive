> I tweeted a thing about why `1/0 = 0` is mathematically sound. Some people agreed, some people agreed with caveats, and some people called it bunk. A few people said it’s clear I don’t know real mathematics, because a real mathematician would never make such a mistake.

> So in this post I’d like to clearly, formally lay out why it’s consistent to say that `1/0 = 0`, why some of the common objections don’t apply, and what the real mathematicians say. Fair warning, this post is going to be a little more mathematically dense than my usual stuff. I’ve tried to make it clear but, well, math.

A post about why [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io)'s decision to make `1/0==0` true is a mathematically consistent, if a bit unusual, choice. Via [Greg Wilson](https://mastodon.social/@gvwilson/113116015024992009), who notes that [gleam](https://gleam.run) also does so.

(I've never heard of gleam before!
