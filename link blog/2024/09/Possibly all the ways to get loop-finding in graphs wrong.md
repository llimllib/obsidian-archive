A very cool walk through how the author implemented graph loop-finding for a few of their games which must warn players when they've created loops.

Ends with a nice explanation of [Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/findloop/#tarjan), which is new to me
