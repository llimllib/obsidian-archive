I've only quoted the start, because the whole thing is absolutely worth reading if you care about this sort of thing.

I have mostly no idea at all how to read [[assembly]], and I still found it enlightening!

The article also mentions [[luajit]] techniques, which I've previously linked in [[Building the fastest Lua interpreter... automatically]] and [[Building a baseline JIT for Lua automatically]]
