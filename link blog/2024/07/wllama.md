Somebody compiled [[llama.cpp]] for webassembly; there's a [demo](https://ngxson.github.io/wllama/examples/basic/) you can play with, and use embeddings to compare vectors, once you download an embedding model.

It would be neat to use this with a small model to see if you could do a reasonable job of doing search on a blog using vector embeddings and cosine similarity, all in the browser.
