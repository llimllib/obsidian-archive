fc is a shell builtin, and `fc <command history number>` opens up the command in a text editor, lets you edit it, and then reruns it.

I feel like I have learned about this before but have never worked it into my daily usage. Would be neat if [[atuin]] would support this feature, like maybe ctrl+o when searching my history would open that command in a text editor, and saving it and quitting would run it.
