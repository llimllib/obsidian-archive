the demo: https://server1.rtwilson.com/aerial

> **Summary:** I’ve created a [demo web app](https://server1.rtwilson.com/aerial) where you can search an aerial photo of Southampton, UK using text queries such as "roundabout", "tennis court" or "ship". It uses vector embeddings to do this – which I explain in this blog post.

I wanted to do something like this in college, but at the time it was much too difficult. Very cool demo!
