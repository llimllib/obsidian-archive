I actually found this out through Kernighan and Pike's chapter on debugging in "The practice of programming". The OED apparently cites Thomas Edison:

> Mr. Edison, I was informed, had been up the two previous nights discovering ‘a bug’ in his phonograph — an expression for solving a difficulty, and implying that some imaginary insect has secreted itself inside and is causing all the trouble

So the common story that [an actual moth](https://daily.jstor.org/the-bug-in-the-computer-bug-story/) in a machine at Harvard is the source of the name "bug" isn't quite accurate, though it does seem to have happened.
