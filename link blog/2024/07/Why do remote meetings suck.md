I don't vibe with the authors' bias against remote work, but I do like and resonate with the idea that what they call "caucus meetings", where whomever speaks first gets the floor, have real problems.

> The format of a caucus encourages participants who want to contribute to _say_ more and _listen_ less... This is a big structural reason why [people interrupt each other all the time](http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/23/study_men_interrupt_women_more_in_tech_workplaces_but_high_ranking_women.html). When the way that you get the floor in a meeting is to _just start talking_, that’s what people do.

In caucus-style meetings, I usually find myself sitting out, too shy to say what I want to say. Or occasionally, worse, I have strong opinions and speak too much.

In [a follow-up article](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/05/how-do-we-make-remote-meetings-not-suck/), they get to proposing a moderator for meetings, on a spectrum from Robert's rules of order through a "facilitator" who participates in and guides the discussion.

I'd love to try some meetings with different rules, but definitely don't feel like I'm the person who would lead that charge.
