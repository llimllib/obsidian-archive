> Are there deeper, more fundamental aspects of software that can help us think beyond surface-level matters? I’ve come to think that a triad of interacting factors best explains what software is and, by extension, why software is difficult:

> - Software occupies a _liminal state_ between the constraints of the physical world and an anything-goes fantasy world. We frequently mistake the constraints that software faces.
  
> - Our ability to specify what a given piece of software should be is limited by the _circular specification problem_. We nearly always have to fully build the software in order to know precisely what we want it to be.
  
> - Software is subject to the _observer effect_. The act of seeing the software in action changes what we – or more often others – think the software should be, sometimes radically.
