> What you think today is the result of what you read yesterday. If you want to have relevant, interesting, useful thoughts; use your reading as a template. It will not only model the topics you are thinking about, but the very thoughts themselves. Itâ€™s as much pruning gossip and irrelevant noise as it is planting the interesting and insightful and well thought-out.
