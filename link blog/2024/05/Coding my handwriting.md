In part 1, the author figures out how to generate a handwriting-like font by defining control points manually, then smoothing them using [[Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm]].

In part 2, they wanted to create a font based on their own handwriting, so they built a little tool to trace the control points on top of a writing sample.

A consistent theme of many articles I admire is when people take the time to build simple, single-purpose tools that aid them in their goals.
