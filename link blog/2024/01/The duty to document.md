> If you learn something the hard way, share your findings with others. You have blazed a new trail; now you must mark it for your fellow travellers. Sharing knowledge is an unreasonably effective way of helping others.

Short blog post, I especially like the title though. Framing it as a duty helps me feel good about writing documentation even when it's not what I want to do - I owe it to my fellow-travelers.
