Guides you through using the `Shorcuts` app to create a command-line interface to Mac OS X's OCR engine, via `shortcuts run ocr-text -i <image file>`.

I tested it out and it works! Very cool. Too bad that none of the [[mac os command line programs]] provide this natively, it would be very useful to provide system functionality without requiring a shortcut.
