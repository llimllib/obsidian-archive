> marimo is a reactive notebook for Python. It allows you to rapidly experiment with data and models, code with confidence in your notebook's correctness, and productionize notebooks as pipelines or interactive web apps.
> 
> Highlights.
> 
> - reactive: run a cell, and marimo automatically updates all affected cells and outputs
> - interactive: bind sliders, tables, plots, and more to Python â€” no callbacks required
> - reproducible: no hidden state, deterministic execution order
> - executable: execute as a Python script
> - shareable: deploy as an app
> - git-friendly: stored as .py files

It's observable, but for python
