> Seashells lets you _pipe output from command-line programs to the web in real-time_, even without installing any new software on your machine. You can use it to monitor long-running processes like experiments that print progress to the console. You can also use Seashells to share output with friends!

Very neat tool idea!

```
$ python train.py | seashells
serving at https://seashells.io/v/{url}
Epoch 1/1000, loss = 12.483
{...}
```
