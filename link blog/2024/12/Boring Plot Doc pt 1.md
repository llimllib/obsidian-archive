Tom MacWright posts his "boring documentation" on how to use observable plot. Via [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/macwright.com/post/3ldcf3okjo22l).

Mike Bostock:
- posted [his take](https://observablehq.com/d/1913762d16628db8) on an "unpivot" or "melt" transform
- posted [this article](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) by Hadley Wickham on "tidy data"; I know of the idea of the tidyverse in R, but haven't read the paper
- [points to](https://bsky.app/profile/ocks.org/post/3ldhgtyf4222n) the docs he expects to answer these questions [here](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks#marks-have-tidy-data) and [here](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/plots#marks-option)
