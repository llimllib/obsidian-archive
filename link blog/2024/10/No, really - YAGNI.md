> Don't add code because "in the future we might …” _Even if. E_ven if the intentions are good, even if the code would be neat, even if, yes, should the day come that we need to solve this problem, this code would solve it well — even then: don't add it.

> You can't predict the future, no one can. What looks probable today might look laughable tomorrow and code added based on what's likely today might be dead code in a few months.
