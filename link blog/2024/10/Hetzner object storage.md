Hetzner [is launching](https://brandur.org/atoms/gwdxua2) a much-cheaper s3 alternative

> - The price difference in storage is night and day, with Hetzner’s service less than 1⁄4 of the price of Amazon.
> - It’s even more stark for transfer out. At $90/TB, Amazon basically owns your data once it’s in their data center. Hetzner’s price is 1/90th AWS’ with a 10x more generous free tier.
> - No per-operation cost is huge. While [reviewing my own S3 costs](https://brandur.org/atoms/gr3xs6c) earlier this year, I was surprised to find that 85% of my bill was per-operation cost.
