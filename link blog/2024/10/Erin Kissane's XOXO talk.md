I like her thoughts on broken social systems and broken corporate/government systems

> [The Dark Forest model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis), which gained popularity because of _Three Body Problem_ and was adapted for the web I think [most elegantly by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web), sort of formalizes this. It posits that the public internet is now so hostile to authentic human sociability that real interaction has to go underground, into private Slacks and Discords and group chats. And this is happening both because the platforms themselves are extractive surveillance monsters and because they’ve incentivized so many predatory, [PvP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player) behaviors.

> In this light, going underground seems wise and protective.

> My fundamental discomfort with that conclusion is that when those of us who _have_ found our people and managed to get even semi-stable retreat into private spaces, we are slamming the doors on all the people who haven’t got there yet. In Dark Forest terms, we’re leaving them up there to get eaten.
