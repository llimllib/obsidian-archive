> I work on the internet professionally, use Rails at my day job, and server management is part of my job description, so I've been able to use my skills to keep botsin.space running on a relative shoestring budget. Until recently, the whole thing ran on one server. But that's not maintainable, and given that and some other concerns, I think that now is the time to retire the server.

That's a shame, and I hope it doesn't speak poorly for the state of the mastodon server generally.
