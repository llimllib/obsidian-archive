> In [Why We Can't Have Nice Software](https://andrewkelley.me/post/why-we-cant-have-nice-software.html), I point out this pattern of needless software churn in the mindless quest for profit. This is a perfect example occurring right now. Redict has already reached its peak; it does not need any more serious software development to occur. It does not need to [pivot to AI](https://redis.com/blog/the-future-of-redis/). It can be maintained for decades to come with minimal effort. It can continue to provide a high amount of value for a low amount of labor. That's the entire point of software!
