> While we hold that bar charts should start at zero, there is [no such expectation for line charts](https://qz.com/418083/its-ok-not-to-start-your-y-axis-at-zero/). But you’ll always find someone on social media to denounce a “dishonest” line chart that enhances the variations by truncating the y-axis. There is usually ample pushback, but it often leads to the question: Where should it start then?

> **The bottom third of the plot area should remain empty for a line chart that doesn’t start at zero.**

> ...We need a middle point. A range that is small enough to show variations, but with a starting point that is low enough to avoid the misperception that the data reached zero.
