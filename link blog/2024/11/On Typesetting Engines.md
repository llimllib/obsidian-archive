The author discusses why they chose to build their resume builder in LaTeX instead of in HTML/CSS or any other alternatives, due to the shortcomings of everything else.

Has a link to [LaTeX.css](https://latex.vercel.app/), which is:

>  an excellent [example](https://latex.vercel.app/) of how HTML & CSS typesetting can be pushed to its limit. It uses `text-align: justify` and `hyphens: auto` to get an optimal, aligned layout for paragraphs. This is almost the best that HTML & CSS can do. If you ever want to do some typesetting with HTML & CSS, this would be a very good reference.

They compare LaTeX to:

- [LaTeX.js](https://latex.js.org/)
- [Typst](https://typst.app/)
	- "a modern typesetting system designed to be an intuitive and efficient alternative to LaTeX"
- [React-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/)
	- a react library that implements knuth-plass line breaking and pagination itself
