@fil demonstrates how to use [[Observable Plot]] to make a quick but still high-quality map of air quality in the US using a publicly available data source

(The map has a minor bounding box issue that excludes the northeast, I made a [tiny fork with a 2-character fix](https://observablehq.com/d/4f2132b3124e905f))
