> In the past year I think I have finally come to understand the ideals of Unix: file descriptors and processes orchestrated with C. It's a beautiful idea. This is not however what we interact with. The complexity was not contained. Instead I deal with DBus and /usr/lib and Boost and ioctls and SMF and signals and volatile variables and prototypal inheritance and `_C99_FEATURES_` and dpkg and autoconf.

> Those of us who build on top of these systems are adding to the complexity. Not only do you have to understand `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to make your system work but now you have to understand `$NODE_PATH` too - there's my little addition to the complexity you must now know!

short, and worth reading in whole.
