`andrewrk` has written a new tool, a colorful and differently-featureful version of [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) ([[hyperfine]]), for doing command line performance analysis, with this interesting name ðŸ’©

> Poop (so far) is brand new, whereasÂ [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)Â is a mature project with more configuration options and generally more polish.

> However, poop does report peak memory usage as well as 5 other hardware counters, which I personally find useful when doing performance testing. Hey, maybe it will inspire the Hyperfine maintainers to add the extra data points!
