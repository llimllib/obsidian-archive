Nice post going through some modern database fundamentals, including illustrative simple implementations of some concepts.

Also mentions [[bloom filters]], and how they're used in RocksDB and ScyllaDB. I updated my [bloom filter tutorial](https://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/) for the first time in _forever_ with links to their implementations.
