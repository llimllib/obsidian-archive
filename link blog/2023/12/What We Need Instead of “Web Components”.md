> The dream of Web Components is a good one, but we need new solutions to match the problems encountered by contemporary web developers, not just a continued retreading of a path laid out a decade ago.

> The basics of my argument are really simple:  
> - Browser makers should try to take stuff developers are doing anyway and bring it into the browser to make it universal and more efficient.  
> - Three areas ripe for that are 1.) reactivity/signals 2.) morphDOM/VDOM reconciliation and 3.) dynamic iframe sizing.  
> That's it!
