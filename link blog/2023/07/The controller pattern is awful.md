Useful thinking about why we make objects, what objects are, what object-oriented means, and when and how we should design objects and classes to contain them.

Don't agree with all of it, but it's always good to think through the basics every once in a while.

Particularly, I'm OK with sometimes using classes as organizational patterns; I greatly prefer the `Job` object to the purely functional pattern they present.
