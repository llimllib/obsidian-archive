> Beavers relocated to a remote Idaho valley have transformed the landscape into a lush wetland and a haven against fire and drought, satellite imagery shows...

> In one such area, Baugh Creek, beavers have visibly altered the landscape, as shown in newly released [satellite imagery](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151591/idahos-emerald-refuge) from NASA. Beavers erected dams that formed ponds and flooded meadows, supporting the growth of grasses and shrubs. A wide swath of vegetation now lines Baugh Creek, which is more verdant than other, nearby waterways.⁠
