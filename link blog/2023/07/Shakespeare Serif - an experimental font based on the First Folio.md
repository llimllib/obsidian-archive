> I recently read thisÂ [wonderful blog post about using 17th Century Dutch fonts on the web](https://www.linyangchen.com/Typography-Fell-Types-font). And, because I'm an idiot, I decided to try and build something similar using Shakespeare's first folio as a template.

A nice walkthrough of the steps the author took to come out at a decent start at a font - there's still a lot of work to do but the things they did got them to a reasonable starting point.
