> Jupyter Notebook 7 is the most significant release of the Jupyter Notebook in years. Some highlights of this release include real-time collaboration, interactive debugging, table of contents, theming and dark mode, internationalization, improved accessibility, compact view on mobile devices.

Awesome! I never really got comfortable trying to use jupyter lab, so I'm glad they've got a new and improved notebook interface out.
