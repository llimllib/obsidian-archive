DHH's personal replacement for k8s for 37signals' apps.

> MRSK seeks to bring the advance in ergonomics pioneered by these commercial offerings (ed: GKE, EKS, fly.io etc) to deploying web apps anywhere. Whether that's low-cost cloud options without the managed-service markup from the likes of Digital Ocean, Hetzner, OVH, etc, or it's your own colocated bare metal. To MRSK, it's all the same. Feed the config file a list of IP addresses with vanilla Ubuntu servers that have seen no prep beyond an added SSH key, and you'll be running in literally minutes.
