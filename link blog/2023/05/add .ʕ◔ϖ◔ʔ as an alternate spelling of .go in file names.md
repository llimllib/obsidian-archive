from rsc, a month past April Fools' day:

> The new (apparently closed-source) programming languageÂ [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)Â uses files named .mojo, but it allows .ðŸ”¥Â as an alternate spelling of .mojo, as inÂ `hello.ðŸ”¥`.

> Clearly Go is being left behind in the Unicode race. We must not let this stand. I propose that we throw caution to the wind and standardize on .Ê•â—”Ï–â—”Ê” as an alternate spelling of .go, as inÂ `hello.Ê•â—”Ï–â—”Ê”`.
