I love the idea of _situated software_ from this talk:

> One coping mechanism is an idea from almost 20 years ago called [situated software](https://gwern.net/doc/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html). This is software with a few users who know each other and share a social context orÂ _situation_. The idea is analogous to local government: services with few stakeholders are often better able to meet the needs of their stakeholders, particularly when everyone knows everyone and there's a certain level of social accountability.

Which is originally from [Clay Shirky](https://gwern.net/doc/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html)

> We've been killing conversations about software with "That won't scale" for so long we've forgotten that scaling problems aren't inherently fatal. The N-squared problem is only a problem if N is large, and in social situations, N is usually not large. A reading group works better with 5 members than 15; a seminar works better with 15 than 25, much less 50, and so on.

The [software powering this blog](https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/tree/main), I would argue, is situated software. My github is full of personal-only use software built in ways that are not sensible for large-scale use, and that I update very infrequently. (I think I'm lucky that none of it has taken off!)

This blog software, for example, is incredibly unclever: every 20 minutes a cron job syncs my notes to the web from my personal laptop. Oftentimes that means it syncs partial entries or things I didn't mean to push up to it, but since it's just for me and I made it in a few hours, that's fine enough. I know what the sharp edges are so there's no need to sand them down.

Simon Willison wrote a bit about something like this when referring to [this news.yc thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35729232) (his blog post is [here](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/28/trainbot/) but I think he tooted about it more than that, unfortunately his blog posts don't link to his toot threads)
