> Here at GDS, weâ€™re making it easier for departments to build better digital services. GOV.UK Forms is an online form builder which can be used to make accessible and easy to use digital forms for GOV.UK. It saves time for departments that are processing form submissions, and time for users that are filling in forms.

gov.uk continues to do impressive work. I'm not in the government world any longer, but I believe this tool is likely to be very successful. There are lots of bad forms out there.
