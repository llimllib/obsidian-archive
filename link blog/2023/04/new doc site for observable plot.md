Mike Bostock comments on the app used to generate it, [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev):

> Slightly off-topic, but I wanted to share what a joy it was to use VitePress to build this new documentation site. We already use Vite for Plot development: instant hot module reloading is fantastic for iterating on tests as you can instantly see the visual effect of your code changes. VitePress brings the same experience to docs, and the default theme (which we use with minor adjustments) is beautiful out of the box.

Also tooltips coming soon!
