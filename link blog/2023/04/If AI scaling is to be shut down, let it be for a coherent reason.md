A call for opponents of AI to come up with coherent bases and arguments for why it should be shut down.

Although I'm very critical of AI models, particularly because of their use of training data that I do not believe they has the right to use, I also feel that many critics are trying to have their cake and eat it too by claiming both that gpt is dangerous and also unimpressive, in ways that are not coherent.

I think that there are ways to coherently argue that what openAI, in particular, is doing is unjustified, it is incumbent upon critics to be thorough and clear with their arguments.
