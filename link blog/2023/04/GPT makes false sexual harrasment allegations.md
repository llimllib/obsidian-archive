Eugene Volokh asked GPT to give him five examples of law professors who have sexually harassed somebody, and it named a real person to blame then made up a non-existent citation to the Washington Post.

None of this is surprising when you think about how GPT works, but what's difficult is imagining how you would combat this. It is convincing enough that real people will definitely be reading what it says and taking it to be truth.
