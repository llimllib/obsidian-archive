Lovely illustration of what times, datetimes, and dates are valid by each spec.

I still say ISO 8601 when I mean "standard date format" but I probably should switch to saying RFC 3339 - it has a smaller set of valid times. Maybe I should even learn a name for one of the times that's in the intersection of the two types?
