> When you start a new project in Go, you might begin by cloning an existing project. That way, you can start with something that already works, making incremental changes instead of starting from scratch.

> For a long time now, we have heard from Go developers that getting started is often the hardest part. New developers coming from other languages expect guidance on a default project layout, experienced developers working on teams expect consistency in their projectsâ€™ dependencies, and developers of all kinds expect an easy way to try new products and services without having to copy and paste from samples on the web.
