One of my beefs with most javascript frameworks is that their documentation rarely has a clear description of what it is doing, where, in terms that I understand.

This article clearly lays out Astro's "content islands" approach and explains what's happening on the server and what's happening on the client, which I appreciate.

In addition, I think it's a pretty compelling pitch, despite my general aversion to javascript on the server.

I found out about it through [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), which looks like a nice little documentation site generator that allows dynamic content but prioritizes client experience and static HTML. (I have never used it though, and it's a kind-of-competitor to my employer)

Astro references [this blog post](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) as an inspiration for the "content islands" approach.

(Side note: they also reference a twitter handle for a person, but I can't see any of their content any more because I won't log in to X. The loss of twitter is a terrible shame for the commons)
