The author of the post went through, and continues to suffer, extreme pain at the hands of the ESM transition.

At the moment, there appears to be nobody who knows the complete story of how one ought to publish javascript code.

Ends with this lament:

> I don't know how anyone is supposed to be able to keep up with all these possible configuration changes, edge cases, runtime environments, and conflicting constraints.
> 
> And there are no actual comprehensive guides on how to do this stuff. Everyone's cargo-culting from others.

> I'm trying to do right by our users and publish packages that work in as many environments as reasonably possible, but this is incredibly frustrating to deal with.

> It's a miracle anything about this ecosystem works at all.
