> Our request to HashiCorp: switch Terraform back to an open source license.

> We ask HashiCorp to do the right thing by the community: instead of going forward with the BSL license change, switch Terraform back to a truly open source license, and commit to keeping it that way forever going forward. That way, instead of fracturing the community, we end up with a single, impartial, reliable home for Terraform where the whole community can unite to keep building this amazing ecosystem.

Hashicorp's license change remains very unpopular, and a group has formed to ask them to revert it or they will form a foundation to move open-source terraform forward.
