> **Peter’s (Race) Pacer** is a Garmin Connect IQ Data Field which resolves 2 issues for me when I’m running a race:

> -   Before the race starts I want to see the current time of the day (well actually I want to see, how long till the race starts?)
> -   When I pace races it used to be doing mental math all the way, now this is no longer necessary as you can fully depend on the average pace/speed, because this data field allows to correct the distance at the kilometer / mile marker by simply pressing the LAP button

> While the data field’s primary intent is to race races, you can also use it to run laps around the track, just set the lap distance to 400 meters and press the lap button as you cross the line!
