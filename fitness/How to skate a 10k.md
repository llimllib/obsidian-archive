The 10k and 5k world record holder gives a detailed account of his training, including a training log.

he trains almost always for 5 days and rests for two. He breaks his training down into three blocks:  

-   a massive amount of aerobic training; just an absolutely staggering amount, with the intention that it will allow him to work hard and recover quickly in the next two blocks
-   he does almost entirely biking for this phase, up to 7 hours a day - he intentionally never skates slowly, not wanting to ruin his technique
-   then a threshold phase, where he adds a high volume of threshold work daily, assuming that the aerobic phase gave him the base to handle the work.
-   he carefully tracks his sleep, lactate buildup, and heart rate to see when he needs to back off, and still takes those 2 days off per week
-   Finally, a sport-specific phase, where he skates at race pace for increasing amounts of time per day, the only skating he does at all in the program
-   he finishes with a block of work past the recovery threshold, followed by a 6-12 day taper, relying on supercompensation to maximize his race results

Also in the document he talks a lot about how focusing on his motivation was a key factor for him - he does everything he can to try and make the training, which is intrinsically very boring, as fun for himself as possible
