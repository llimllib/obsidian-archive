> I always had my own custom box scores that incorporated a lot of what I cared about. I've had them for 20 years, putting new things in and modifying parts here and there. At [ESPNAnalytics.com](https://espnanalytics.com/), we're actually rolling out a basic version of my box scores this coming week. It will have information on player value, how good the starters vs bench were, defensive information, the Four Factors, and so forth. We'll grow it from this point and make it better, but it's pretty good now. For me, that's my cheat sheet.

I'm not sure what `net points` are, he says:
> Net Points: Points above average created on offense/defense by teams and players. Should add up to point differential (or very close).

but it's not clear to me exactly what that means.

He also has boxes for best/worst overall/offense/defense, again sorted by "net points":

If you click into the detailed box score, you get this:

The presentation of all of this could definitely use some work; I like some aspects of it and should consider them as I go forward with my game logs.
