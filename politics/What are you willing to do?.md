> The shock of the live-streamed event (Jan 6 storming of the Capitol), feeble as it was compared to the promised ‘coming storm’ of QAnon, was a distraction from other more significant and ominous events in the same location. The mob that tried to take over the Capitol had a more effective team on the inside, wealthy, educated and successful, dressed in business wear, taking a premeditated stance against democracy from the benches of Congress itself: 139 Republican members of the House of Representatives, more than half the party bloc and just shy of two-thirds of the number needed for a majority, voted to reject the presidential election results from one or both of Arizona and Pennsylvania – two states that had swung for Joe Biden. Eight of the fifty Republican senators also voted against certifying all state results.

From an interesting book review, thoroughly reviewing a book on civil wars and arguing that sometimes civil wars are justified and necessary.

I'm not agreeing or disagreeing, but it is interesting and thoughtful throughout.
