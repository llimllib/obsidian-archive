> The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs.

> It's a re-write of [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT), which I think became too complicated, and which I am hesitant to now touch. Still under active development, currently working to reproduce GPT-2 on OpenWebText dataset. The code itself aims by design to be plain and readable: `train.py` is a ~300-line boilerplate training loop and `model.py` a ~300-line GPT model definition, which can optionally load the GPT-2 weights from OpenAI. That's it.
