> Open Assistant is a project meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model...
> We want to get to an initial MVP as fast as possible, by following the 3-steps outlined in the InstructGPT paper.

> We are not going to stop at replicating ChatGPT. We want to build the assistant of the future, able to not only write email and cover letters, but do meaningful work, use APIs, dynamically research information, and much more, with the ability to be personalized and extended by anyone. And we want to do this in a way that is open and accessible, which means we must not only build a great assistant, but also make it small and efficient enough to run on consumer hardware.
