> **llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file. ([announcement blog post](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/))**

> Our goal is to make open source large language models much more accessible to both developers and end users. We're doing that by combining [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a "llamafile") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.

The first compelling usage of Cosmopolitan that I've seen. I'm currently downloading [mixtral](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#other-example-llamafiles) to try it out and see how it works on my machine.
