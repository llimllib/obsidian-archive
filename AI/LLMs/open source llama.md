> Independent implementation of LLaMA that is fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
> 
> This implementation builds on nanoGPT.
> 
> Why?
> 
> We believe that AI should be fully open source and part of the collective knowledge.
> 
> The original LLaMA code is GPL licensed which means any project using it must also be released under GPL.
> 
> This "taints" any other code and prevents meaningful academic and commercial use.
> 
> Lit-LLaMA solves that for good.
