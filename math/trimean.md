I came across the [trimean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimean) today, which I'd not heard of before:

> a [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average "Weighted average") of the distribution's [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median "Median") and its two [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartiles "Quartiles"):

$$TM= \frac{Q_1 + 2Q_2 + Q_3}{4} $$
