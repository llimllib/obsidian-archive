I [added a new feature](https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/commit/6ac4945fd702a6ce633922e28c73eb7efa014f30) to notes.billmill.org, separate blogs. Here they all are:

- [full feed](https://notes.billmill.org/atom.xml)
- [link blog](https://notes.billmill.org/link_blog.atom.xml)
- [music blog](https://notes.billmill.org/music_blog.atom.xml)
- [blog blog](https://notes.billmill.org/blog.atom.xml)

I'm also planning to improve the quality of the feeds, I put a few notes on this in [[Feeds are not fit for gardening]]. At the least, I plan to add summaries and avoid putting minor edits into the feeds.
