Last year I kept my advent of code log in a note on this site: [[2023 problem log]]

This year I wanted to make it easier for me to generate and share visualizations, and break the code into more logical explanations, so I'm doing it at https://llimllib.github.io/advent2024/ in an [observable framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) notebook.

The source code is [all on github](https://github.com/llimllib/advent2024), but hopefully the notebook provides an easy reading experience.

I've tried to do visualizations for anything that can be remotely visualized, and plan to play around with it some more and learn more about framework and plot.
