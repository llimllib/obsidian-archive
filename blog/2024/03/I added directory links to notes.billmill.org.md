Now I can link to a directory directly. For example, [here's all my python notes](https://notes.billmill.org/programming/python.html).

The CSS needs work, but I've already found the links super handy.

I also added a header to each note with a link to each directory it's contained within, so there's some idea of where it lives within the overall site.

The main bulk of the work is in [this commit](https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/commit/c09867eae4d6c6beb19841696b84a2c5b7950894)
