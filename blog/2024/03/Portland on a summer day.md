I went browsing through photos on the [gateway to astronaut photography of earth](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/) this morning, and came upon [this lovely shot of my hometown](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS069&roll=E&frame=53588) on a clear August day.

Here it is in full resolution with a few touchups in [[affinity photo]]. I recommend opening it in full resolution and having a browse around.
