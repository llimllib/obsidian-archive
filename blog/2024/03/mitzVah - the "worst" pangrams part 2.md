_update apr 2_: I accidentally deleted this article and now have re-posted it

in [[What are the "worst" spelling bee pangrams?|part 1]], I introduced the spelling bee and the concept of the "worst" pangram, which I defined as the one which produced the fewest possible words. Then I wrote and described a program that found them, and labelled `equivoke` the Worst Pangramâ„¢.

I thought I was done getting nerdsniped after that, but a few people helpfully provided bits of information I was missing the first time, and I also thought a bit more about the problem to change its definition a bit.

## more better information

People shared two bits of information with me that I didn't have when I started:

- On mastodon, Brad Greenlee [shared](https://fiasco.social/@brad/112108107787262025) [a wordlist](https://github.com/bgreenlee/spelling-beat/blob/main/js/application.js#L4) he's been working on for his spelling bee solver. This pared-down scrabble wordlist is much closer to what a real spelling bee word list looks like
- On reddit, `cearrach` informed me that a Genius score is 70% of the total points for a puzzle.

I took Brad's word list (thanks!) and added calculation of the word score and each pangram's total score. I didn't mention how words are scored in the first article:

- a 4 letter word is worth 1 point
- any word with more than 4 letters is worth as many points as it has letters
- a pangram scores a 7 point bonus

This led to a funny result, where `fuckwit` was the new "worst" pangram:

## back to the beginning

The initial prompt for this exploration was a question about whether there were any spelling bee puzzles where just the pangram would get you to the "genius" level.

I had changed the question to suit the knowledge I had at the start, but now I realized I had enough information to try and answer the original question.

I looked at that list and realized that if you set the puzzle as `jacquard`, and used the `q` as a required letter, you'd have only the pangram and three additional words: `aqua`, `qajaq` (an alternative spelling of `kayak`, apparently!) and `quad`. That would give you:

- `jacquard`: 7 + 8 = 15 points
- `aqua`: 1
- `qajaq`: 5
- `quad`: 1

So `jacQuard` would result in a puzzle where the pangram was responsible for 15/22 points, or just a tiny hair below genius level. Could we do better?

I took the same program I used in part 1 and added a search through each letter of the pangram, scoring the result of making that letter required.

Here's a table of every pangram my program finds that would reach genius level all by itself:

## implementation

Following the same start of the program I used to find the word count for every pangram in [[What are the "worst" spelling bee pangrams?|part 1]], I added a couple more loops:

- let $scoresWithReqLetters$ be a list of tuples ($totalScore$, $requiredLetter$, $pangram$)
- For each pangram
  - find all words that match the pangram
  - for each letter in the pangram
    - sum the score of each word that contains the letter
    - add that score, the letter, and the pangram to $scoresWithReqLetters$
- Sort $scoresWithReqLetters$
- For each pangram
  - if the score of the pangram is > 70% of $totalScore$, print it out

The implementation in python:

```python
@cache
def wscore(w):
    return (1 if len(w) == 4 else len(w)) + (7 if len(allwordsets[w]) == 7 else 0)


# find all matches for each pangram, then the score for each possible required
# letter
scores_with_req_letters = []
pangram_matches = {}
for points, _, pangram in pangrams:
    ps = allwordsets[pangram]
    matches = [w for w in allwords if allwordsets[w].issubset(ps) and w != pangram]
    for l in ps:
        lmatches = [m for m in matches if l in m]
        pangram_matches[(pangram, l)] = lmatches
        score = len(pangram) + 7 + sum(wscore(m) for m in lmatches)
        scores_with_req_letters.append((score, l, pangram))


@cache
def hl(w: str, l: str) -> str:
    return f"{red}{w.replace(l, f'{yellow}{l}{red}')}"


red = "\N{esc}[0;31m"
green = "\N{esc}[0;32m"
yellow = "\N{esc}[0;33m"
blue = "\N{esc}[0;34m"
reset = "\N{esc}[0m"
print(f"{green}points\tpangram\t\twords")
scores_with_req_letters.sort()
for points, l, pangram in scores_with_req_letters:
    matches = pangram_matches[(pangram, l)]
    panscore = wscore(pangram)
    total = panscore + sum(wscore(m) for m in matches)
    if (panscore / total) > 0.7:
        matchstr = ",".join(matches)
        if len(matchstr) > 60:
            matchstr = matchstr[:59] + "..."
        print(
            f"{blue}{points: <8}{hl(pangram, l)}{' ' * (16-len(pangram))}{reset}{matchstr}"
        )
```

I didn't dive much into performance, but here's a few notes:

- pypy runs this program quite a bit faster than cpython on my machine, roughly 46s to 77s
- The program spends almost all its time finding every matching word for every pangram, if I were to speed it up that would be the loop I would target
- Caching the construction of all sets at the beginning of the run was a simple and significant performance win

With that, I feel like I can finally wash my hands of this problem! (Maybe? we'll see!)
