You would think that every kind of chat server imaginable would already exist, but I want a chat server that:

- **is open source**: users can see and build off the source
	- It should be easy to build chat bots and other integrations
- **is simple to use**: users can reasonably understand it without being highly technical
	- examplar: Slack, Telegram
	- non-technical users can reasonably join the chat with both phones and computers
- **is simple to run**: semi-technical users should be able to host it
	- As far as I know, there is no chat software that I would consider "simple to run"
	- This is **the** direction I would really want to push a chat server: what is the extreme level of "simple to run for a small group"
- **is private**: can reasonably be considered secure. 
	- examplar: Signal
	- I wouldn't want to compromise UX to support security to the extent that Signal does, but the software should aspire to its thorough consideration of privacy
- **does not support a million users**
	- The goal of this software is to _support small groups_
