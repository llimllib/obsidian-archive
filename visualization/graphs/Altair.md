> Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) and [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite), and the source is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/altair-viz/altair).

> With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. Altairâ€™s API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) visualization grammar. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.
