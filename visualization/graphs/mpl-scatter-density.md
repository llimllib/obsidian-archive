> The **mpl-scatter-density** mini-package provides functionality to make it easy to make your own scatter density maps, both for interactive and non-interactive use. Fast. The following animation shows real-time interactive use with 10 million points, but interactive performance is still good even with 100 million points (and more if you have enough RAM).

Extension for [[matplotlib]] to rapidly graph _lots_ of points

Found via [this neat article](https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/benchmarking-malloc-with-doom3/) about bnechmarking memory allocations; the author replays all allocations from a few minutes of playing Doom 3, and graphs the time they took.
