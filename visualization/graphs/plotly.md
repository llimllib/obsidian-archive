> Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.
> Plotly.py is [free and open source](https://plotly.com/python/is-plotly-free) and you can [view the source, report issues or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py).

Plotly started as a python graphing library and has migrated to start selling itself as a low-code development environment.

The library is open source, but much of it I find confusingly wrapped up in the sometimes-free sometimes-not website.
