Contains an interesting history and theory of arrows on maps (they represent literal arrows! This is something I had not considered before) and goes into how they can be productively used and some alternatives. Uses maps of refugee migration from Ukraine as a motivating example where arrows may not be appropriate symbols for conveying mass movements of refugees.
