I've used d3 for a bunch of projects:

- [nba stats explorer](https://llimllib.github.io/nbastats/) and the [team efficiency chart](https://llimllib.github.io/nbastats/teams/)
- [portland reassessment map](https://billmill.org/reassess/)
- [lichesstree](http://llimllib.github.io/lichesstree/)
- [radial NCAA tournament bracket](https://llimllib.github.io/roundbracket/)
- [NCAA tournament randomizer](https://llimllib.github.io/ncaa-bracket-randomizer/)
- this [map of the provenance of US and Canadian runners of the Boston marathon](http://llimllib.github.io/bostonmarathon/maps/)
- a [graph of relative covid rates](https://llimllib.github.io/covidgraph/)
	- (the data is all messed up now, so it no longer looks like it should, sadly)
- [soccer team ratings](https://llimllib.github.io/ratesoccer/), an experiment in displaying a sparkline-like graphic in a table
- Some [solving-sol](https://solvingsol.com/) drawings, lightly interactive. Click and drag to experiment

	- [016](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/016/llimllib/index.html)
	- [046](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/046/llimllib/index.html)
	- [049](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/049/llimllib/index.html)
	- [130](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/130/llimllib/index.html)
	- [1136](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/1136/llimllib/index.html)
		- my personal favorite, which [I blogged about](https://billmill.org/sol_1136.html) because I had to learn about bezier curves to draw it

And wrote a few blog posts:
