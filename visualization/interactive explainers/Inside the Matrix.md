> Matrix multiplications (matmuls) are the building blocks of today’s ML models. This note presents [mm](https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html), a visualization tool for matmuls and compositions of matmuls.

> Because mm uses all three spatial dimensions, it helps build intuition and spark ideas with less cognitive overhead than the usual squares-on-paper idioms, especially (though not only) for visual/spatial thinkers.

> ...[mm](https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html)’s visualization approach is based on the premise that _matrix multiplication is fundamentally a three-dimensional operation_.
