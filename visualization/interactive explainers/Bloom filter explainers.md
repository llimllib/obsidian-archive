So this one time, I wrote an interactive explainer for bloom filters: https://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/

I'd never used them, and I wanted to give a lunch and learn talk on them, so I did some research and ended up with that.

Some time later I noticed that the excellent Jason Davies made their own, shorter, explanation: https://www.jasondavies.com/bloomfilter/

Just today, I stumbled on this one, via [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/13/load-balancing/):  https://samwho.dev/bloom-filters/ . This one has the interesting feature of making graphs of the false positive rate equations I discussed but didn't make interactive.
