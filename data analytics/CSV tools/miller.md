https://github.com/johnkerl/miller

Aims to be a tool similar to xsv/jq/csvkit, but for CSV, TSV, and JSON

> Miller is **multi-purpose**: it's useful for **data cleaning**, **data reduction**, **statistical reporting**, **devops**, **system administration**, **log-file processing**, **format conversion**, and **database-query post-processing**.

> Miller complements **data-analysis tools** such as **R**, **pandas**, etc.: you can use Miller to **clean** and **prepare** your data. While you can do **basic statistics** entirely in Miller, its streaming-data feature and single-pass algorithms enable you to **reduce very large data sets**.

Has a nice "why" page:
