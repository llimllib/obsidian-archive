> I am happy to share that our paper "Caravan - A global community dataset for large-sample hydrology" is now officially published. You can find the paper at [nature.com/articles/s41597-023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01975-w#Sec8)

> Caravan are two things:  
1. A large-sample hydrology dataset (~7k basins) with globally consistent forcing data + attributes.  
2. A community project to build a dynamically growing dataset with better global coverage over time. (more details in reply to this post).
