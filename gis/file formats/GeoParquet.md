> This repository defines how to store geospatial [vector data](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-data-types-vector-raster/) (point, lines, polygons) in [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), a popular columnar storage format for tabular data - see [this vendor explanation](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) for more on what that means. Our goal is to standardize how geospatial data is represented in Parquet to further geospatial interoperability among tools using Parquet today, and hopefully help push forward what's possible with 'cloud-native geospatial' workflows.
