> A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. It does this by leveraging the ability of clients issuing â€‹[HTTP GET range requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233) to ask for just the parts of a file they need.
