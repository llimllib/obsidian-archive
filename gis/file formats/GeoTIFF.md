> The GeoTIFF format was initially developed during the early 1990â€™s (N. Ritter & Ruth, 1997). The objective was to leverage a mature platform independent file format (TIFF) by adding metadata required for describing and using geographic image data. TIFF met the requirements for an underlying format, as it was - and still is (though JPEG compression was added) - lossless and extensible.
