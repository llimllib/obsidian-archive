> OpenFreeMap lets you display custom maps on your website and apps for free.

> You can either [self-host](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap/blob/main/docs/self_hosting.md) or use our public instance. Everything is **open-source**, including the full production setup — there’s no 'open-core' model here. The map data comes from OpenStreetMap.

>Using our **public instance** is completely free: there are no limits on the number of map views or requests. There’s no registration, no user database, no API keys, and no cookies. We aim to cover the running costs of our public instance through donations.
