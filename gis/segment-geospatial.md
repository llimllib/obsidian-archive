> The **segment-geospatial** package draws its inspiration from [segment-anything-eo](https://github.com/aliaksandr960/segment-anything-eo) repository authored by [Aliaksandr Hancharenka](https://github.com/aliaksandr960). To facilitate the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for geospatial data, I have developed the [segment-anything-py](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-anything) and [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial) Python packages, which are now available on PyPI and conda-forge. My primary objective is to simplify the process of leveraging SAM for geospatial data analysis by enabling users to achieve this with minimal coding effort.
