> Planetiler (_**pla**·nuh·tai·lr_, formerly named "Flatmap") is a tool that generates [Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) from geographic data sources like [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Planetiler aims to be fast and memory-efficient so that you can build a map of the world in a few hours on a single machine without any external tools or database.
> Vector tiles contain raw point, line, and polygon geometries that clients like [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre) can use to render custom maps in the browser, native apps, or on a server. Planetiler packages tiles into an [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.3/spec.md) (sqlite) file that can be served using tools like [TileServer GL](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) or even [queried directly from the browser](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs). See [awesome-vector-tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles) for more projects that work with data in this format.

Would be fun to play around with generating some vector tiles and displaying them in the browser
