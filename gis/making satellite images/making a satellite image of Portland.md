- I went to [earth explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and signed up for an account
- searched for images covering Portland with low cloud cover, and downloaded one
- that got me a bunch of TIF files, a few txt files, and an xml file

That's what I've got so far - the plan here is to try and use the tools in Rob Simmon's [[A Gentle Introduction to GDAL]] series to make a nice image of my hometown, and maybe figure out how to automate this after that
