> MBTiles is a specification for storing arbitrary tiled map data in [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) databases for immediate usage and for efficient transfer. MBTiles files, known as **tilesets**, must implement the specification below to ensure compatibility with devices.

I _think_ I used [TileStache](http://tilestache.org/) in the day to generate our custom tiles? But I don't remember exactly.

There are currently [lots of implementations](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/wiki/Implementations) of generators and servers.
