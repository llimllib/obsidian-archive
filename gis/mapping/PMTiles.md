> PMTiles is a single-file archive format for pyramids of tiled data. A PMTiles archive can be hosted on a storage platform like S3, and enables low-cost, zero-maintenance map applications. See [Storage Providers](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles/storage-providers) for how to host PMTiles on your own service.

Similar to [[MBTiles]], but tmcw says "Brandon Liuâ€™s brilliant [PMTiles](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles) format is what MBTiles should have been"

[PMTiles viewer](https://protomaps.github.io/PMTiles/) is a useful companion tool, which will display a pmtiles file on a world map.
