[Flatmap](https://github.com/onthegomap/flatmap)

Flatmap is a tool that generates [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) from geographic data sources like [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Flatmap aims to be fast and memory-efficient so that you can build a map of the world in a few hours on a single machine without any external tools or database.
