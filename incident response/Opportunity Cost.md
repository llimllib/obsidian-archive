from [this blog post](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/opportunity-cost-action-bias-cybersecurity-incident-response/)

> -   Overlooking [opportunity cost](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/real-life-examples-opportunity-cost) – the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when a choice is made – is rife within infosec decision-making across all activities, not just incident response (IR); get hyped for more on this from Josiah and me soon
> -   One way to start incorporating opportunity cost in practice is by considering the “null baseline”; in the context of incident response, it means considering the option of _waiting_ to act
> -   [Action bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/action-bias) is especially bad for IR because _any_ option may be chosen without regard for its cost or value – and such rushed decisions can lead to suboptimal outcomes
