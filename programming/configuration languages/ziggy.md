> A data serialization language for expressing clear API messages, config files, etc. 

> Ziggy uses different notation for key-value pairs when the keys are controlled by the application (i.e. keys must follow a schema), versus when the user is in control, and thus expected to come up with key names...

> Ziggy schemas help you define data layouts that are easy to grasp and validate for correctness. Ziggy schemas can define struct unions, enums and custom string literals.

> The Ziggy LSP will be able to use your schema definitions to show diagnostics, contextual help and give autocomplete suggestions to your users.
