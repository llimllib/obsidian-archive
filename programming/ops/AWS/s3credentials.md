tool from Simon Willison for creating appropriate s3 bucket credentials

> A tool for creating credentials for accessing S3 buckets

> For project background, see [s3-credentials: a tool for creating credentials for S3 buckets](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/) on my blog.

> Why would you need this? If you want to read and write to an S3 bucket from an automated script somewhere, you'll need an access key and secret key to authenticate your calls. This tool helps you create those with the most restrictive permissions possible.
