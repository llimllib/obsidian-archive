> Fast and reliable background jobs in Go.

> Atomic, transaction-safe, robust job queueing for Go applications. Backed by PostgreSQL and built to scale.

From [the hn thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38349716):

> Transactional job queues have been a recurring theme throughout my career as a backend and distributed systems engineer at Heroku, Opendoor, and Mux. Despite the problems with non-transactional queues being well understood I keep encountering these same problems. I wrote a bit about them here in our docs: [https://riverqueue.com/docs/transactional-enqueueing](https://riverqueue.com/docs/transactional-enqueueing)

> Ultimately I want to help engineers be able to focus their time on building a reliable product, not chasing down distributed systems edge cases. I think most people underestimate just how far you can get with this modelâ€”most systems will never outgrow the scaling constraints and the rest are generally better off not worrying about these problems until they truly need to.
