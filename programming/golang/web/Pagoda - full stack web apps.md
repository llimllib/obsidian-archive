> Rapid, easy full-stack web development starter kit in Go

> _Pagoda_ is not a framework but rather a base starter-kit for rapid, easy full-stack web development in Go, aiming to provide much of the functionality you would expect from a complete web framework as well as establishing patterns, procedures and structure for your web application.

> Built on a solid [foundation](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda#foundation) of well-established frameworks and modules, _Pagoda_ aims to be a starting point for any web application with the benefit over a mega-framework in that you have full control over all of the code, the ability to easily swap any frameworks or modules in or out, no strict patterns or interfaces to follow, and no fear of lock-in.
