> Rapid is a Go library for property-based testing.

> Rapid checks that properties you define hold for a large number of automatically generated test cases. If a failure is found, rapid automatically minimizes the failing test case before presenting it.

> Rapid aims to bring to Go the power and convenience [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) brings to Python.
