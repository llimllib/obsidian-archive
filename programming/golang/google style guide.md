I particularly dig this bit, from the guide:

> Go code should be written in the simplest way that accomplishes its goals, both in terms of behavior and performance. Within the Google Go codebase, simple code:
>
> -   Is easy to read from top to bottom
> -   Does not assume that you already know what it is doing
> -   Does not assume that you can memorize all of the preceding code
> -   Does not have unnecessary levels of abstraction
> -   Does not have names that call attention to something mundane
> -   Makes the propagation of values and decisions clear to the reader
> -   Has comments that explain why, not what, the code is doing to avoid future deviation
> -   Has documentation that stands on its own
> -   Has useful errors and useful test failures
> -   May often be mutually exclusive with “clever” code
