Simple, yet powerful entity framework for Go, that makes it easy to build and maintain applications with large data-models.

-   **Schema As Code** - model any database schema as Go objects.
-   **Easily Traverse Any Graph** - run queries, aggregations and traverse any graph structure easily.
-   **Statically Typed And Explicit API** - 100% statically typed and explicit API using code generation.
-   **Multi Storage Driver** - supports MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Gremlin.
-   **Extendable** - simple to extend and customize using Go templates.

I'd really like to use this, but haven't had the project for it yet.
