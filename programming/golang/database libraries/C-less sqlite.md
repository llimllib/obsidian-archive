https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite is a [[sqlite]] driver for go that does not use any C; it is automatically translated from golang.

It uses their own [C compiler](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/cc/v3#section-readme) to do the translation. I'm just going off a few comments I've read - I'd love to read in more detail about how it works.
