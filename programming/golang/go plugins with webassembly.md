> `go-plugin` is a Go (golang) plugin system over WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm). As a plugin is compiled to Wasm, it can be size-efficient, memory-safe, sandboxed and portable. The plugin system auto-generates Go SDK for plugins from [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) files. While it is powered by Wasm, plugin authors/users don't have to be aware of the Wasm specification since the raw Wasm APIs are capsulated by the SDK.
