> A newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to estimate systems performance â€” fast, and without writing any code! However, on a good day posts will include code to test whether the napkin math lines up with reality.

A table of performance ballpark numbers:

The [archive page](https://sirupsen.com/?filter=code) is a bit difficult to parse, as it has non-napkin-math posts scattered in it.
