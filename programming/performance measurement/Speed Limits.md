> Sometimes you just want to know how fast your code _can_ go, without benchmarking it. Sometimes you have benchmarked it and want to know how close you are to the maximum speed. Often you just need to know what the current limiting factor is, to guide your optimization decisions.

> Well this post is about that determining that _speed limit_[1](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2019/06/11/speed-limits.html#fn:speedlemire). Itâ€™s not a comprehensive performance evaluation methodology, but for many _small_ pieces of code it will work very well.
