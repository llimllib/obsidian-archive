### How does Cell improve on existing languages?

> The single most important improvement is in the way information is represented. Cell's data model combines a staple of functional programming, [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), with relations and other ideas from relational databases. That alone goes a long way toward simplifying (drastically, in some cases) both the data structures used to encode the state of an application and the code that manipulates them. The data model and type systems are also entirely structural, which brings a number of benefits that are discussed elsewhere, and most importantly enables one of the language's major features: orthogonal persistence.

An interesting article about why a new language is needed, and why the author thinks elevating relational and reactive to the programming language level is important
