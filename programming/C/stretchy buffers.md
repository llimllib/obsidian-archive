[here](https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap/blob/3d85cc1f27b5319c7e175fea2b89290a1bd7905a/libcperciva/datastruct/elasticarray.c) are cperciva's stretchy buffers

[stb stretchy buffers](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/af1a5bc352164740c1cc1354942b1c6b72eacb8a/deprecated/stretchy_buffer.h), which I learned about from Per Vognsen, have moved into a deprecated folder? I don't know why

ah ha! it moved into [stb_ds.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/af1a5bc352164740c1cc1354942b1c6b72eacb8a/stb_ds.h), which also includes hash maps
