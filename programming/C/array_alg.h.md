> The C++ STL is one of the most complete and reusable algorithm libraries available. This single header file brings 80% of that functionality to C99 in a non-intrusive way. There are no new data structures. Just include the library and call functions on C arrays.

- Sets (intersection, union, subset, etc)
- Heaps (priority queues)
- Binary search (lower bound, upper bound, etc)
- Sorts (insertion sort, quick sort, merge/stable sort, heap sort, partial sort, etc)
- Partitioning (partition, unique, etc)
- Predicates (all of, any of, none of, etc)
- Uniform random sampling and shuffling
