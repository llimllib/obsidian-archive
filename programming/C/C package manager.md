> Basically the lazy-man's copy/paste promoting smaller C utilities, also serving as a nice way to discover these sort of libraries. From my experience C libraries are scattered all over the web and discovery is relatively poor. The footprint of these libraries is usually quite large and unfocused. The goal of `clibs` is to provide stand-alone "micro" C libraries for developers to quickly install without coupling to large frameworks.

> You should use `clib(1)` to fetch these files for you and check them into your repository, the end-user and contributors should not require having `clib(1)` installed. This allows `clib(1)` to fit into any new or existing C workflow without friction.

> The wiki [listing of packages](https://github.com/clibs/clib/wiki/Packages) acts as the "registry" and populates the `clib-search(1)` results.
