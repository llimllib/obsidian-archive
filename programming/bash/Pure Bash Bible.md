So many useful bash snippets.

I submitted a PR to add command line parsing: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible/pull/122

but it seems like the book may not be under active development any longer.

While doing so, I found a good example of fancier arg parsing in `neofetch`: https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/blob/ccd5d9f52609bbdcd5d8fa78c4fdb0f12954125f/neofetch#L5239
