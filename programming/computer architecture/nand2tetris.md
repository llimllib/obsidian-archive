> The site contains all the lectures, project materials and tools necessary for building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.  
  
> The materials are aimed at students, instructors, and self-learners. Everything is free and open-source, as long as you operate in a non-profit, educational setting.  

> The materials also support two on-line courses: [Nand2Tetris Part](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) [](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)[I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) (hardware projects/chapters 1-6), and [Nand2Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) (software projects/chapters 7-12).

I actually own the book that accompanies this course, through an impulse purchase, but have never cracked it open. I should give it a start.
