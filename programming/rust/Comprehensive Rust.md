> This is a four day Rust course developed by the Android team. The course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling. It also includes Android-specific content on the last day.

> The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you donâ€™t know anything about Rust and hope to:
> -   Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
> -   Enable you to modify existing programs and write new programs in Rust.
> -   Show you common Rust idioms.
