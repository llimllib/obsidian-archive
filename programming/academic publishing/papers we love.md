> Papers from the computer science community to read and discuss.

> **Papers We Love**Â (_PWL_) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers. This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit theÂ [Papers We Love site](http://paperswelove.org/)Â for more info.

> Due toÂ [licenses](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#respect-content-licenses)Â we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see aÂ ðŸ“œÂ emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide links to their locations.

> If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discussÂ _PWL_Â events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related toÂ _PWL_Â on ourÂ [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tu2VynkRWV)Â server.
