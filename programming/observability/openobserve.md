> OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, RUM (Real User Monitoring - Performance, Errors, Session Replay) designed to work at petabyte scale.

> It is straightforward and easy to operate, in contrast to Elasticsearch, which requires understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running in under 2 minutes.

> OpenObserve serves as a seamless replacement for Elasticsearch for users who ingest data using APIs and perform searches. OpenObserve comes with its own user interface, eliminating the need for separate installation.

> You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using OpenObserve. Below, we present the results from pushing logs from our production Kubernetes cluster to both Elasticsearch and OpenObserve using Fluent Bit.
