> HyperDX helps engineers figure out why production is broken faster by centralizing and correlating logs, metrics, traces, exceptions and session replays in one place. An open source and developer-friendly alternative to Datadog and New Relic.

> HyperDX is compatible with OpenTelemetry

> HyperDX is open core, with most of our features available here under an MIT license. We have a cloud-hosted version available at hyperdx.io with a few additional features beyond what's offered in the open source version.
