mostly unmaintained, but also functional. The httpbin.org server is wobbly sometimes.

`go-httpbin` offers very similar functionality to `httpbin`, but written in go and can serve TLS. Much easier to deploy, so I've started using it in a docker container for testing [httpsnippet](https://github.com/readmeio/httpsnippet), and I've contributed a few improvements so that it can be used in that setting.
