> The Art Institute of Chicago provides access to all of our public data through a single, unified API (Application Programming Interface). It’s powered by a data hub, a system our engineers built to collect public information from a number of different internal systems. In our API, you’ll find data on our collections, digital publications, in-gallery interactives, mobile apps, shop products, events, and more.
