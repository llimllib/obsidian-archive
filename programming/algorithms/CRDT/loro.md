> Loro, our high-performance [[CRDT]]s library, is now open source...

> Time travel a document with 360,000+ operations using Loro. To load the whole history and playback, it only takes 8.4MB in memory. And the entire history only takes 361KB in storage...

> Our CRDTs library is built on the brilliant concept of OT-like CRDTs from Seph Gentle's [Diamond-type](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types). Seph Gentle is currently writing a paper on it, which is worth looking forward to. Its notable features include reducing the cost of local operations, easier historical data reclamation, and sometimes lower storage and memory overhead. However, it relies on high-performance algorithms to apply remote operations. This design has great potential and we are excited about its future.
