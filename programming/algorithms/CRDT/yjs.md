> Yjs is a [CRDT implementation](https://github.com/yjs/yjs#Yjs-CRDT-Algorithm) that exposes its internal data structure as _shared types_. Shared types are common data types like `Map` or `Array` with superpowers: changes are automatically distributed to other peers and merged without merge conflicts.
