An [[Interactive explainer]] on using CRDTs for text editing from evanw, author of esbuild, who is exploring collaborative text editing algorithms.

The [source code](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-text-buffer/crdt-text-buffer.js) implementing the CRDT is intentionally written for readability rather than performance

There are other demos at the site, such as [CRDT: Fractional Indexing](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-fractional-indexing/); see [the list here](https://madebyevan.com/algos/)
