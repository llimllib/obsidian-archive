> In this tutorial, we'll... talk about Approximate Nearest Neighbor Oh Yeah (Annoy), an algorithm that uses a forest of trees to conduct the nearest neighbor search. For those familiar with random forests or gradient-boosted decision trees, Annoy can seem like a natural extension of these algorithms, only for the nearest neighbor search rather than machine learning. As with our HNSW tutorial, we'll first walk through how Annoy works from a high level before developing our own simple Python implementation.
