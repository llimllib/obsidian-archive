> A useful property of a spacefilling curve is that it tends to visit all the points in a region once it has entered that region. Thus points that are close together in the plane will tend to be close together in appearance along the curve.

> This forms the basis of the heuristic, invented by L. Platzman and me, to produce a reasonably short tour of _n_ given locations (the so-called Travelling Salesman's Tour): Simply visit them in the same sequence as does the spacefilling curve. For example, a short tour of the points marked in read is indicated by the green lines, which connect the points in the same sequence as their appearance on the spacefilling curve
