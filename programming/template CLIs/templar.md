> Templar is both a Rust library and a CLI tool for working with templates. The usage and style is inspired by both Jinja2 and Ansible, though it is not intended to be a clone of either of these.

> The goal of the project is to provide fast and flexible dynamic templating, particularly for use with configurations and local tooling. Despite this, it likely can be adapted for HTML and front end rendering as well.

> ...Much of the syntax is based on the wonderful [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) project. Here are some of the currently supported features.
