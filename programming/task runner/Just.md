A command runner, modeled on make with dependencies but without the file building element. Has a much more modern UI with decent errors and can list your tasks.

Each label is just a task name, not a target.

A neat addon is `just.sh`, which will compile a `Justfile` into a shell script: https://github.com/jstrieb/just.sh
