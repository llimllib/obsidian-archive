> SwissGL is a minimalistic wrapper on top of [[WebGL]]2 JS API. It's designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to manage GLSL shaders, textures and framebuffers when making GPGPU-style procedural visualizations or simulations. See the [demos](https://github.com/google/swissgl/blob/main/demo) for examples of using SwissGL. As of now the library consists of a standalone <700 loc .js file.

Has a good example in the README
