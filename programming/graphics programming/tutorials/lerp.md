> Today I want to talk about a little animation trick that I use all the time called **lerp**. Lerp is the nickname for Linear Interpolation between two points. It’s a fairly simple effect to implement but can really improve the look of your animations if you’re moving an object from a point A to point B.

Nice little demos of the concept embedded in this [[Interactive explainer]]
