Walks you rapidly through creating a 2d shader toy, introducing each step along the way.

Points a bunch at https://iquilezles.org, which looks like a really useful resource for this.

- [palettes](https://iquilezles.org/articles/palettes/) among [many other useful functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/)
	- [sdf functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/)
- [graphtoy](https://graphtoy.com) is a very cool way to visualize GLSL functions over time

Also points at [this gradient tool](http://dev.thi.ng/gradients/) from Karsten Schmidt, author of the very impressive but intimidating [thingumbrella](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella) library of libraries
