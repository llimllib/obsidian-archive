> ClayGL is a WebGL graphic library for building scalable Web3D applications.

> It's easy to use, configurable for high-quality graphics. Benefit from the modularity and tree shaking, it can be scaled down to 22k(gzipped) for a basic 3D application.

Also has a nice [library of example apps](http://examples.claygl.xyz/)

I'm not sure how it compares to [[ThreeJS]]
