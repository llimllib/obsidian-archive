> gpu-io is a [[WebGL]] library that helps you easily compose GPU-accelerated computing workflows. This library can be used for a variety of applications including real-time physics simulations, particle/agent-based simulations, cellular automata, image processing, and general purpose GPU computations. gpu-io supports rendering directly to the WebGL canvas and has some built-in features that make interactivity easy. See [Examples](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/) for more details.

Very cool demos, tries to simplify working with shaders in simulation
