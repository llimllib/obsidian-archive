PICO-8 is a [fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq) for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. It _feels_ like a regular console, but runs on Windows / Mac / Linux. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a commandline, a suite of cartridge creation tools, and an online cartridge browser called SPLORE.

Have had some fun programming this with the boys
