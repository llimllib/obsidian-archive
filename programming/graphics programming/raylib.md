> raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming

> raylib does not provide the typical API documentation or a big set of tutorials. The library is designed to be minimalistic and be learned just from a cheatsheet with all required functionality and a big collection of examples to see how to use that functionality.Â **Best way to learn to code is reading code.**

[here's the cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)
