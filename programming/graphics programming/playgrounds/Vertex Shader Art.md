Similar to [[shadertoy]], but limited to a vertex shader and simplifies the code's interface with that assumption.

> Cleary inspired by [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com/) this one only lets you edit a vertex shader. The vertex shaders main input is just a `vertexId` that counts vertices.

> Because limits are AWESOME! Like 4k demos (or 1k) setting limits almost always leads to more creativity.
