> Now that GPUs have ray tracing units, real-time path tracing is coming into reach. Applications beyond movie rendering and baking embrace it, and therefore more people need to know about it. At [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/graphics-research/overview.html), I recently offered a path tracing workshop to educate a broad audience of engineers on basics of the topic. I am happy to announce that we decided to make this [workshop publicly available](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/path-tracing-workshop-part-1.html). If you know a few math and programming basics, you can watch 76 minutes of videos and solve some [exercises on ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/playlist/NfjSRy) as you go. In the end, you will have written your own ray tracer and a path tracer on top of it! I simplified things as much as possible, but you will really write all key aspects of the path tracer and understand why they work.
