> Overmind is a process manager for Procfile-based applications and [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/). With Overmind, you can easily run several processes from your `Procfile` in a single terminal.

> -   Overmind starts processes in a tmux session, so you can easily connect to any process and gain control over it;
> -   Overmind can restart a single process on the fly — you don't need to restart the whole stack;
> -   Overmind allows a specified process to die without interrupting all of the other ones;
> -   Overmind can restart a specified processes automatically when they die;


> If a lot of those features seem like overkill for you, especially the tmux integration, you should take a look at Overmind's little sister — [Hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind)!
