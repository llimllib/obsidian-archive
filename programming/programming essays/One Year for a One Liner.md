it's a good technical/systemic war story, but I like the reflections on trust and gatekeeping more

-   assume nothing. the people around you might be wrong! you might be wrong too!
-   test all hypotheses. each test gives you more information.
-   eliminate gatekeeping. no team can afford to cope with the damage done by people who want to keep information or access away from their colleagues.
-   observability, even humble standard metrics, is invaluable.
-   you (o fellow technical leader) own everything. you must always feel the responsibility of that ownership. you can share it, but itâ€™s always partly yours.
-   trust but verify. especially team superstitions.
-   ruthlessly eliminating developer friction pays unexpected dividends.
