- [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd)
	- with related project [[devd]], a development webserver
	- this is what I usually use, it's not maintained but it works fine enough
- [watchexec](https://watchexec.github.io/) ([github](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)) ([cargo](https://lib.rs/crates/watchexec-cli))
	- I've not used it, but it looks like it would do the job without much fuss
	- available on brew with `brew install watchexec`
- [fswatch](https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/) ([github](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch))
	- looks to be very full featured, but the CLI is too complex for casual usage
	- Paul Smith wrote a [simple bash reloader](https://github.com/paulsmith/reloader.sh) that wraps it
- [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) ([github](https://github.com/eradman/entr))
	- you pipe a file list into `entr` instead of watching by a glob, which makes it tricky to notice when files are added
- [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) ([github](https://github.com/facebook/watchman))
	- To run a command when a js or ts files changes, use `watchman-make`, Example:
	- `watchman-make -p '**/*.js' '**/*.ts' --run 'npx jest'`
	- [docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/watchman-make)
	- does not seem to support extended glob syntax, so you can't use `**/*.{js,ts}` as the value provided to the `-p` option
- [watchfiles](https://watchfiles.helpmanual.io/) ([github](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/watchfiles))
	- Simple, modern and high performance file watching and code reload in python.
	- both a python lib and a [cli tool](https://watchfiles.helpmanual.io/cli/)
		- the cli is very python-oriented
		- `watchfiles "go test" **/*.go` works as advertised though, and runs `go test` when any go file changes
		- it has a reasonably low file limit, which can be a problem in node setups with node_modules
			- In that case, use something like:
			- `watchfiles "npx jest" $(fd -g --exclude node_modules "*.{ts,js}"`
- [reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex)
	- a golang file watcher that looks pretty good, supports config files
- [turbowatch](https://github.com/gajus/turbowatch/)
	- a scriptable node file watcher built on top of watchman. I used it in my [[uswds]] template project, and it seemed nice
- [gow](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) 
	- "**Go** **W**atch: missing watch mode for the `go` command. It's invoked exactly like `go`, but also watches Go files and reruns on changes."
	- only for go
	- based on [rjeczalik/notify](github.com/rjeczalik/notify), like modd is
- [gaze](https://github.com/wtetsu/gaze) 
	- a file watcher that is optimized around running files immediately after you save them; by default it tries to guess how to run the file.
	- so if you run `gaze .` and edit a file `something.py`, it will run `python something.py` every time you save, by guessing that you want to run the file with `python`
	- you can customize the mapping with the `-c` option
- [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
	- designed particularly for watching go apps, but customizable build and run commands
