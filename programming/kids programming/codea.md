> Codea for iPad lets you create games and simulations — or any visual idea you have. Turn your thoughts into interactive creations that make use of iPad features like Multi-Touch and the accelerometer.

> We think Codea is the most beautiful code editor you'll use, and it's easy. Codea is designed to let you touch your code. Want to change a color? Just tap and drag it. How about an image or a sound? Tap your code to bring up visual editors that let you choose exactly what you want.

> Codea is built on the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) programming language. A simple, elegant language that doesn't rely too much on symbols — a perfect match for iPad.
