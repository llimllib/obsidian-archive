> My 11 year old has a lot of interest in creating games... Does anyone know whatâ€™s out there that would work for them?

Some of the suggestions:

- [[Scratch]]
- [code it!](https://app.code-it-studio.de/course/step/4/44)
- [blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)
- [minecraft education](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us)
- [enu](https://getenu.com/) (3d logo-ish in nim(!))
- lots of votes for [[Game Maker]]
- [[godot engine]]
- One suggestion is for video games for creating other games: little big planet, rpg maker, super mario maker
- [MS MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/)
- [construct](https://editor.construct.net/)
- [[pico8]]
	- I've used this with the kids, it's fun.
	- [[programming/retro imaginary consoles/tic-80|tic-80]] as well
- [[pygame zero]]
- [fuze4](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fuze4-nintendo-switch-switch/) ([their site](https://www.fuze.co.uk/about-fuze4-nintendo-switch.html)) for making games on nintendo switch
- [microstudio](https://microstudio.dev/)
- [gamefroot](https://make.gamefroot.com/)

There's a ton of stuff in the "kids make games" space!

A few suggestions for roblox, but I've heard enough bad things about it and there's plenty alternatives.
