I believe that the humble cookbook is an underused form of documentation for programming languages and frameworks.

My favorite cookbook of all time is the, sadly defunct, bl.ocks.org. It looked something like this:

To use it, you would create a github gist [like this one](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/5249328), which would have a brief text and some [[d3.js]] code to create an HTML element and event listeners, allowing it to create an interactive diagram.

The beauty of blocks was that it was:

- simple to create
- easy to copy somebody's example
- let you search for simple examples of how to use a particular d3 api
- inspiring

I believe that blocks was responsible for a great deal of the popularity of d3; I know that it is certainly how I picked it up.

A cookbook example that I love, but wish I understood better, is the wonderful [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsXXDB), which I think has similarly helped a great deal of people learn to program shaders.

Another example is [codepen](https://codepen.io/), which lets you post snippets of HTML/javascript/CSS that work together to demonstrate techniques for building web pages. Codepen has spawned many very similar services.
