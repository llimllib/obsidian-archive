> A set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project.

> Pure builds on [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and provides layout and styling for native HTML elements, plus the most common UI components. It's what you need, without the cruft.

I like that it has good layout examples, I always struggle to lay out pages and components well.
