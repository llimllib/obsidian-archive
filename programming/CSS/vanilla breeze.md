> Convert Tailwind CSS to Semantic CSS

via [daily drop](https://dailydrop.hrbrmstr.dev/2024/03/25/139502858/):

> Longtime Drop readers know I dislike/detest Tailwind for CSS. I won’t re-hash why, here, but I was glad to discover [Vanilla Breeze](https://www.vanillabreeze.dev/). It’s an online tool that lets you turn Tailwind-classed HTML tags to semantic CSS.

> I’m prototyping something at work and the UX design+implementation team uses Tailwind, so this has been a $DEITY-send for me. Just paste in a spec and get back some real, proper CSS.
