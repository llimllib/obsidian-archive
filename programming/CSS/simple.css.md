> When starting a new project, I wanted a CSS framework that would get me up and running quickly, and give me something I could hack on. I got sick of all these giant frameworks that include everything but the kitchen sink, 90% of which Iâ€™ll never use. For example, the minified CSS for the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) is **144KB in total**. By comparison, Simple.css is around **10KB**.
