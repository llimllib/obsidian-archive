> ImHex is a Hex Editor, a tool to display, decode and analyze binary data to reverse engineer their format, extract informations or patch values in them.Â   
  
> What makes ImHex special is that it has many advanced features that can often only be found in paid applications. Such features are a completely custom binary template and pattern language to decode and highlight structures in the data, a graphical node-based data processor to pre-process values before they're displayed, a disassembler, diffing support, bookmarks and much much more. At the same time ImHex is completely free and open source under the GPLv2 language
