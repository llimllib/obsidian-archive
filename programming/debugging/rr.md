> rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux, replacing — well, enhancing — gdb. You record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. The same execution is replayed every time.

> rr also provides efficient reverse execution under gdb. Set breakpoints and data watchpoints and quickly reverse-execute to where they were hit.

> rr works on real applications and is used [by many](https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Testimonials) [developers](https://twitter.com/chandlerc1024/status/879962014860193792) to fix real bugs. It makes debugging hard bugs much easier, but also speeds up debugging of easy bugs.
