> In our newly released [nbdev2](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), an open source [[Jupyter]]-based development platform, we’ve solve each of the problems:

> 1.  A new _merge driver_ for git provides “notebook-native” conflict markers, resulting in notebooks that can be opened directly in Jupyter, even when there are git conflicts
> 2.  A new _save hook_ for Jupyter automatically removes all unnecessary metadata and non-deterministic cell output.

Provides sensible diff and merge for colloaboration on jupyter notebooks
