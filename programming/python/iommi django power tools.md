> iommi is a toolkit to build web apps faster. It's built on Django but goes a lot further.

-   [forms](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/forms.html): that feel familiar, but can handle growing complexity better than Django's forms
-   [tables](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/tables.html): that are powerful out of the box and scale up to arbitrary complexity
-   a system to [compose parts](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/pages.html):, like forms, menus, and tables, into bigger pages
-   tools that will speed up your development like live edit, jump to code, great feedback for missing select/prefetch related, a profiler, and more.
-   great error messages when you make a mistake
