> Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

> Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus a variety of plugins), [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/), [`pydocstyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [`yesqa`](https://github.com/asottile/yesqa), [`eradicate`](https://pypi.org/project/eradicate/), [`pyupgrade`](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/), and [`autoflake`](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

> Ruff goes beyond the responsibilities of a traditional linter, instead functioning as an advanced code transformation tool capable of upgrading type annotations, rewriting class definitions, sorting imports, and more.
