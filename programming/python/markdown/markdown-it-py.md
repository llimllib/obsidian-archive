What I switched to for notes.billmill.org after starting with [[python-markdown]], along with [mdit-py-plugins](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdit-py-plugins) for additional functionality.

There is a beta [rust version markdown-it-pyrs](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/markdown-it-pyrs), however it cannot have python plugins at the moment.
