> And yet, despite this ubiquity, the topic hypermedia itself is a strangely under-explored concept today, left mainly to specialists. Yes, you can find a lot of tutorials on how to author HTML, create links and forms, etc. But it is rare to see a discussion of HTML _as a hypermedia_ and, more broadly, on how an entire hypermedia _system_ fits together.

> This is in contrast with the early web development era when concepts like _Representational State Transfer (REST)_ and _Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)_ were discussed frequently, refined and debated among web developers.

> In a sad turn of events, today, the worldâ€™s most popular hypermedia, HTML, is often viewed resentfully: it is an awkward, legacy markup language that must be grudgingly used to build user interfaces in what are increasingly entirely Javascript-based web applications.
