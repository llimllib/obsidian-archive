> A JavaScript implementation of [gRPC](https://grpc.io) for browser clients. For more information, including a **quick start**, see the [gRPC-web documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/web).

> gRPC-web clients connect to gRPC services via a special proxy; by default, gRPC-web uses [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).

> In the future, we expect gRPC-web to be supported in language-specific web frameworks for languages such as Python, Java, and Node. For details, see the [roadmap](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/blob/master/doc/roadmap.md).

Currently requires a proxy
