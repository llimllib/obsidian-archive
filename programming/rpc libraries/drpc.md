> A drop-in, lightweight gRPC replacement.

go/c++/rust/node implementations

> -   Simple, at just a few thousand [lines of code](https://github.com/storj/drpc/#lines-of-code).
> -   [Small dependencies](https://github.com/storj/drpc/blob/main/blob/main/go.mod). Only 3 requirements in go.mod, and 9 lines of `go mod graph`!
> -   Compatible. Works for many gRPC use-cases as-is!
> -   [Fast](https://github.com/storj/drpc/#benchmarks). DRPC has a lightning quick [wire format](https://github.com/storj/drpc/wiki/Docs:-Wire-protocol).
> -   [Extensible](https://github.com/storj/drpc/#external-packages). DRPC is transport agnostic, supports middleware, and is designed around interfaces.
> -   Battle Tested. Already used in production for years across tens of thousands of servers.
