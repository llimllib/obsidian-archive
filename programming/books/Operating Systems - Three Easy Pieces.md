> Welcome to **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** (now **version 1.10** -- see [book news](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/combined.html) for details), a free online operating systems book! The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: **virtualization,** **concurrency,** and **persistence.** In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. Lots of fun stuff!
