> In contrast to the ubiquitous presence of C programs and systems, good knowledge of and about C is much more scarce. Even experienced C programmers often appear to be stuck in some degree of self-inflicted ignorance about the modern evolution of the C language. A likely reason for this is that C is seen as an "easy to learn" language, allowing a programmer with little experience to quickly write or copy snippets of code that at least appear to do what it’s supposed to. In a way, C fails to motivate its users to climb to higher levels of knowledge.
>
> This book is intended to change that general attitude, so it is organized in levels that reflect familiarity with the C language and programming in general. This structure may go against some habits of the book’s readers; in particular, it splits some difficult subjects (such as pointers) across levels in order to not swamp readers too early with the wrong information.
