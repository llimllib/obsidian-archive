> MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the [introductory tutorial](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), then check the [User Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) for more information.

Several people on news.yc report using the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) which does look much nicer than the mkdocs site by default
