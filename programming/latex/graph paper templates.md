> Make your own quadrille, graph, hex, etc. paper! Uses the [PGF/TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) package for LaTeX, which should be part of any modern TeX installation. All colors and spacing are customizable.

> Once you clone or download the repo, simply run latex twice on the file "graph paper.tex" to produce a pdf. From the command line, type:

```
pdflatex "graph paper.tex"
```

neat! Has lots of different types of graph paper.
