> AsciiDoc is a plain text markup language for writing technical content. It’s packed with semantic elements and equipped with features to modularize and reuse content. AsciiDoc content can be composed using a text editor, managed in a version control system, and published to multiple output formats.

> AsciiDoc is designed to strike a balance between systematic, machine-oriented syntax and natural language. This design affords AsciiDoc the ability to capture and encode nearly all the semantics of a highly-structured language while still being readable in source form.

> AsciiDoc appears **strikingly similar** to Markdown, making way for an easy transition. Where AsciiDoc shines is in **its depth**. AsciiDoc provides all the essential elements in **technical writing** out of the box. **No variants** needed. Its syntax can be elaborated without having to fundamentally change the language, assuring users that it’s still **standard AsciiDoc**.
