rst is a precursor to [[markdown]]. I've seen it used primarily in [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), the python language documentation generator.

Rather than write rst directly, I have previously used [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (part of the [[Executable Book Project]]) to take advantage of the quality rst publication toolchain. `MyST` seems similar to [[AsciiDoc]].
