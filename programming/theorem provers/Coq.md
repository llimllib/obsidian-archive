> Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the [certification of properties of programming languages](https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/List%20of%20Coq%20PL%20Projects) (e.g. the [CompCert](http://compcert.inria.fr) compiler certification project, the [Verified Software Toolchain](http://vst.cs.princeton.edu/) for verification of C programs, or the [Iris](https://iris-project.org) framework for concurrent separation logic), the [formalization of mathematics](https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/List%20of%20Coq%20Math%20Projects) (e.g. the full formalization of the [Feit-Thompson theorem](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00816699), or [homotopy type theory](http://homotopytypetheory.org/coq/)), and [teaching](https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/CoqInTheClassroom).

Coq is in the process of being renamed `rocq`
