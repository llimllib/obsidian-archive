A textbook for [[Lean]], via [the math is haunted](https://overreacted.io/the-math-is-haunted/); which also points to [[The Natural Number Game]] that I started and enjoyed.

Honestly I need a mathematical theorem-proving hobby like I need a hole in the head but I really dig playing around with lean.
