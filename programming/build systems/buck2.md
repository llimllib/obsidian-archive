A build system by (among others) Neil Mitchell, one of the authors of [[Build systems รก la carte]], one of my favorite papers.

I read the manual, and I'll be honest with you that I have no idea at all what is going on here, or how somebody could learn to use this system.

For example, let's say I wanted to use it to bundle my javascript, ok there's a function `js_bundle`, great! Let's look at [the docs](https://buck2.build/docs/api/rules/#js_bundle)!

Umm, what? If I ran that rule I have no idea at all what would actually happen on my computer, which is here on earth, not in outer space where this command resides.
