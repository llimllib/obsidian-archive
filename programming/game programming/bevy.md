> Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

> Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/migration-guides/), but we can't guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

Documentation book [here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/)

Cheat book: https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/

> This book aggregates a lot of community wisdom that is often not covered by official documentation, saving you the need to struggle with issues that others have figured out already!
