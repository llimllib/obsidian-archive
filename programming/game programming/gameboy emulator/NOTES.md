My main idea is to possibly do a class at work on creating an emulator in javascript:

- A talk on writing one in Rust
	- https://media.ccc.de/v/rustfest-rome-3-gameboy-emulator
	- he wrote a book: https://rylev.github.io/DMG-01/public/book/
		- > If you really want to know how a particular computer works, there's no better way to learn than by emulating that computer. In this book, we'll be looking at one of the most loved computers of all time, Nintendo's Game Boy. We'll be going through the process from nothing and building the Game Boy up piece by piece. In the process not only will we learn more about the Game Boy itself, but we'll also get a good glimpse into how computers work in general as well as how to build emulators for other computer systems.
