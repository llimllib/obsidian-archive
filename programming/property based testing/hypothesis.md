> Hypothesis is a Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldnâ€™t have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy to add to any existing test suite.

> It works by letting you write tests that assert that something should be true for every case, not just the ones you happen to think of.
