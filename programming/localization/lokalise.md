Useful-looking localization tool. Got it from [this toot](https://mastodon.social/@TodePond/110072513245111324) by Lu Wilson (who has since migrated to `@TodePond@universeodon.com`)

> We've been using [https://lokalise.com](https://lokalise.com/ "https://lokalise.com/") for managing translations within [@tldraw](https://mastodon.social/@tldraw@mas.to "tldraw@mas.to") and it has been SO GOOD.

> Highly recommend it for making sure your site/app/whatever is accessible to everyone!
