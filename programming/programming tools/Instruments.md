On mac, Instruments (part of xcode) is the app that lets you sample a binary's performance to see where it's spending its time. 

- https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/ has some info about it

similar to [[perf + flamegraph]] on linux, I think? Would like to test using it with a [[Zig]] binary.
