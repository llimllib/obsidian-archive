> Crosscut is a stylus & tablet tool for drawing dynamic models of your thoughts. It aspires to be a _thing to think through_. In Crosscut you sketch, cobble, tinker, and play toward a deeper understanding. Begin by using the drawing tools to sketch something youâ€™re thinking about, as you would with pen & paper. Then, add dynamic behaviors with a programming system that lives right inside your sketches. Each dynamic sketch is a reusable part that you can nest inside other sketches, enabling you to build elaborate models from simple pieces.
