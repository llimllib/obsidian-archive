> [Buf](https://buf.build)'s goal is to replace the current paradigm of API development, centered around REST/JSON, with a **schema-driven** paradigm. Defining APIs using an [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) provides numerous benefits over REST/JSON, and [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) is by far the most stable and widely adopted IDL in the industry. We've chosen to build on this widely trusted foundation rather than creating a new IDL from scratch.

> But despite its technical merits, actually _using_ Protobuf has long been more challenging than it needs to be. The Buf CLI and the [BSR](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf#the-buf-schema-registry) are the cornerstones of our effort to change that for good and to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients alikeâ€”in other words, to create a **modern Protobuf ecosystem**.

Can confirm that the protobuf CLI is pretty terrible and confusing as heck. Haven't used this, but seems neat.

There's some sort of commercial offering, not sure exactly how that works
