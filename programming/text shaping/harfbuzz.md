Harfbuzz has some [convenient command-line utilities](https://harfbuzz.github.io/utilities.html) to expose its internals. Here, we'll ask it to tell us how it shapes a string with some ascii characters followed by unicode characters and an emoji, in a particular font (`UbuntuMono-Regular` in this case):

```
$ hb-shape ~/Library/Fonts/UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf "test: Îºá½¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµðŸ”¥"  
[t=0+500|e=1+500|s=2+500|t=3+500|colon=4+500|space=5+500|kappa=6+500|uni1F79=7+500|sigma=8+500|uni03BC=9+500|epsilon=10+500|.notdef=11+500]
```

> The default output syntax reports each glyph name (or glyph index if there is no name) followed by its cluster value, its horizontal and vertical position displacement, and its horizontal and vertical advances.

It's useful to note that hb-shape tells us that the fire emoji is listed as `.notdef`; i.e. it was unable to shape the cluster within the given font.

(I'm still working on the terminology here, so if I make mistakes, I apologize)

You can use `hb-view` to actually render it to an image. It's neat that `hb-view` detects that my terminal is capable of image output, and displays an image by default:

The fire emoji is a relatively easy case; it's just one character; the Jamaican flag is actually two characters.

```
$ hb-shape ~/Library/Fonts/UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf "test: Îºá½¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµðŸ”¥ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²"
[t=0+500|e=1+500|s=2+500|t=3+500|colon=4+500|space=5+500|kappa=6+500|uni1F79=7+500|sigma=8+500|uni03BC=9+500|epsilon=10+500|.notdef=11+500|.notdef=12+500|.notdef=12+500]
```

In fact, just entering this string messes up my terminal's font rendering! ([issue here](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3810))

We can see from the `hb-shape` output that we will get three tofu blocks when we render the string; it ends with three `.notdef`, which are our two grapheme clusters.

```
$ hb-view ~/Library/Fonts/UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf "test: Îºá½¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµðŸ”¥ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²"
```

(You can see the artifacts at the end of the terminal line there)

Anyway, we can render our emoji with the apple emoji font, but of course we'll lose the characters:

```
$ hb-view /System/Library/Fonts/Apple\ Color\ Emoji.ttc "Îºá½¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµðŸ”¥ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²"
```

Some [documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/README.md#font-fallback) for chromium talks about how they handle font fallback:

> The sectionÂ [Text Shaping](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/README.md#Text-Shaping)Â illustrates that font selection during shaping is part of an iterative process, which first tries to use as many glyphs as possible from the primary font, then in subsequent iterations proceeds to fill gaps from the secondary font and so on until there are no more so calledÂ `.notdef`Â glyphs, i.e. no more boxes of text for which no glyph was found.

```
$ hb-shape /System/Library/Fonts/Apple\ Color\ Emoji.ttc "Îºá½¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµðŸ”¥ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²"
[.notdef=0+800|.notdef=1+800|.notdef=2+800|.notdef=3+800|.notdef=4+800|u1F525=5+800|u1F1EF_u1F1F2=6+800]
```

This time, we can see that harfbuzz is able to shape the emoji in the apple emoji font, but not the letters.
