> CS 6120 is a PhD-level [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) course by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/%7Easampson/) on programming language implementation. It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection. The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) and [an educational IR invented just for this class](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/).

> This page lists the curriculum for following this course at the university of your imagination, for four imagination credits (ungraded). There’s a linear timeline of lessons interspersed with papers to read. Each lesson has videos and written notes, and some have _implementation tasks_ for you to complete. Tasks are all open-ended, to one degree or another, and are meant to solidify your understanding of the abstract concepts by turning them into real code. The order represents a suggested interleaving of video-watching and paper-reading.
