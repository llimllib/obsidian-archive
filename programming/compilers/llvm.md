> The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.

> LLVM began as a [research project](https://llvm.org/pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html) at the [University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/), with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of [commercial and open source](https://llvm.org/Users.html) projects as well as being widely used in [academic research](https://llvm.org/pubs/).

The compiler backend for clang, [[rust]], formerly [[zig]], and many others.
