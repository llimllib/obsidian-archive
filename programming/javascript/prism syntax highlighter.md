> Prism is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern web standards in mind. It’s used in millions of websites, including some of those you visit daily.
> 
> Dead simple
> Include prism.css and prism.js, use proper HTML5 code tags (code.language-xxxx), done!  
> Intuitive
> Language classes are inherited so you can only define the language once for multiple code snippets.
> Light as a feather
> The core is 2KB minified & gzipped. Languages add 0.3-0.5KB each, themes are around 1KB.  
> Blazing fast
> Supports parallelism with Web Workers, if available.
> Extensible
> Define new languages or extend existing ones. Add new features thanks to Prism’s plugin architecture.  
> Easy styling
> All styling is done through CSS, with sensible class names like .comment, .string, .property etc
