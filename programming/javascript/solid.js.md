Article comparing it to react: https://typeofnan.dev/solid-js-feels-like-what-i-always-wanted-react-to-be/

> Solid stands on the shoulders of giants, particularly React and Knockout. If you've developed with React Hooks before, Solid should seem very natural. In fact, more natural as Solid's model is much simpler with no Hook rules. Every Component executes once and it is the Hooks and bindings that execute many times as their dependencies update.

> Solid follows the same philosophy as React with unidirectional data flow, read/write segregation, and immutable interfaces. It however has a completely different implementation that forgoes using a Virtual DOM.
