> Observable isn’t just a platform that you can use to create all of your data visualizations — from simple charts to robust data apps. It’s a community of data practitioners, a library of examples you can build from, and a place where you can grow.

An interactive javascript notebook site.

A few I have created:

- [resting heart rate graph](https://observablehq.com/d/0142cee508202014), with annotations of how the spike in my RHR data relates to the timing of my covid symptoms
- [figuring out how to use duckdb and plot on observable](https://observablehq.com/d/85b37a73dc1d5888)
- [a map of the rate of covid vaccinations in Maine](https://observablehq.com/@llimllib/maine-vaccination-rate-as-of-6-14)
- [a tour of the HMDA API](https://observablehq.com/d/806ac56cc90c1290), made for a hackathon with the CFPB. Includes maps of Chicago housing information, including minority population percentage and loan denial rates

I like working with observable well enough, but I dislike how challenging it is to take code from a notebook and turn it into a normal webpage enough that I usually just start with a normal web page.

There are some nice conveniences of having things set up for you in observable though, for sure.
