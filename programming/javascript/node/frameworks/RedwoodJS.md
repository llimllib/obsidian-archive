> Redwood is the full-stack web framework designed to help you grow from side project to startup. Redwood features an end-to-end development workflow that weaves together the best parts of React, GraphQL, Prisma, TypeScript, Jest, and Storybook. For full inspiration and vision, see Redwood's README.

> Development on Redwood happens in the redwoodjs/redwood repo on GitHub. The docs are there too. While Redwood's founders and core team handle most of the high-priority items and the day-to-day, Redwood wouldn't be where it is without all its contributors! Feel free to reach out to us on the forums or on Discord, and follow us on Twitter for updates.

Being built out by Tom Preston-Werner. I heard about it from [this podcast](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/jamstack-radio/ep-133-react-server-components-with-tom-preston-werner-of-redwoods) via [this toot](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/111205453118655822)

Seems to want to be Rails-like. Tom:

> we envision it as a bit more like Ruby on Rails where if you're building with Rails you expect to have everything out of the box that you need, the basic components, in order to build and test and run your whole life with building web applications...

> That's kind of where we come in and say, "Look, you don't have to build all this integration anymore. We've done the integration. We've chosen these things that work together, use them and you'll be able to really fast, building the thing that you care about, your actual valuable thing. Not all of the underlying technology that you just have to put together in order to build and test your application."
