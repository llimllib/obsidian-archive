> A node library to display charts in popup windows and save them as pngs. Supports observablehq/plot, vega-lite and plotly out of the box.

> In notebook-based systems or IDEs like RStudio, it's nice to create a quick chart or map from your data. There aren't that many similar solutions for Node.js, however. This library is a small bridge that allows you to take advantage of these or similar charting libraries such as [observablehq/plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot), [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) or others to renders charts in a browser environment directly from a Node script, see the results in a minimal popup window and save the image.
