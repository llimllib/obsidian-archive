> Web's fastest and most memory-flexible full-text search library with zero dependencies.

> When it comes to raw search speed [FlexSearch outperforms every single searching library out there](https://nextapps-de.github.io/flexsearch/bench/) and also provides flexible search capabilities like multi-field search, phonetic transformations or partial matching.

> Depending on the used [options](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch#options) it also provides the [most memory-efficient index](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch#memory). FlexSearch introduce a new scoring algorithm called ["contextual index"](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch#contextual) based on a [pre-scored lexical dictionary](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch#dictionary) architecture which actually performs queries up to 1,000,000 times faster compared to other libraries. FlexSearch also provides you a non-blocking asynchronous processing model as well as web workers to perform any updates or queries on the index in parallel through dedicated balanced threads.
