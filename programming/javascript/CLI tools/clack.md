## Effortlessly build beautiful command-line apps ðŸª„

> [`@clack/core`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack/blob/main/packages/core#readme): unstyled, extensible primitives for CLIs
> [`@clack/prompts`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack/blob/main/packages/prompts#readme): beautiful, ready-to-use CLI prompt components

I just released [a render CLI tool](https://github.com/readmeio/rendish) today, and it uses a much simpler system for prompts. Possibly I should use this to polish that up.

Found via [[Observable Framework]], which uses it to good effect.
