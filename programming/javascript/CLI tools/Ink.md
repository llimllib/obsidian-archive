> React for CLIs. Build and test your CLI output using components.

> Ink provides the same component-based UI building experience that React offers in the browser, but for command-line apps. It uses [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga) to build Flexbox layouts in the terminal, so most CSS-like props are available in Ink as well. If you are already familiar with React, you already know Ink.

I built a terrible version of this by hand, so I'd be interested in maybe trying it out some day, though I'm nervous that bringing actual react in would opt the project into dependency hell.
