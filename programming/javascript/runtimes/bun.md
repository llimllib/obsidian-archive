> Develop, test, run, and bundle JavaScript & TypeScript projectsâ€”all with Bun. Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, [test runner](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test), and Node.js-compatible [package manager](https://bun.sh/package-manager).

The node.js compatibility is not perfect, but sometimes you can get big wins from using bun instead.
