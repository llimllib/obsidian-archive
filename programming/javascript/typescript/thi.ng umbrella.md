A monorepo that does lots of [[WebGL]] and visualization related stuff. Difficult to get my head around how to use it/ how to use part of it / what's in there

An interesting example is https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/examples/webgl-channel-mixer

Which shows how to use the suite to create a 2d webgl user interface for editing image channels. I'd like to study it to learn how to do 2d webgl simple stuff, but I'm not sure how much I'd be able to learn because it's all so tied together in the monorepo
