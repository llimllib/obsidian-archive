You can append `#:~:text=bananas` to a URL to highlight the text `bananas` on the page that's linked. You can append `#:~:text=initio,finito` to highlight all text from `initio` to `finito`.

For example, [this link](https://notes.billmill.org/link_blog/2024/10/No__really_-_YAGNI.html#:~:text=You%20can't,no%20one%20can) highlights the phrase `You can't predict the future, no one can`.

In addition, the browser will scroll the page to the first instance of the fragment text. [this link](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html#:~:text=Call%20me%20Ishmael) will take you to `Call me Ishmael`, the opening sentence of Moby Dick.

I'm very excited to use this feature! I wish it'd been around for a long time.
