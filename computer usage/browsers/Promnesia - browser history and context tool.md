I'm intrigued by the idea but the documentation looks sketchy at best

> See a [writeup](https://beepb00p.xyz/promnesia.html) on history and the problems Promnesia is solving. Here’s a short summary.

-   Has it ever occurred to you that you were reading an old bookmark or some lengthy blog post and suddenly realized you had read it already before? It would be fairly easy to search in the browser history, however, it is only stored locally for three months.
-   Or perhaps you even have a habit of annotating and making notes elsewhere? And you wanna know quickly if you have the current page annotated and display the annotations. However, most services want you to use their web apps even for viewing highlights. You don’t know if you have highlights, unless you waste time checking every page.
-   Or you have this feeling that someone sent you this link ages ago, but you don’t remember who and where.
-   Or you finally got to watch that thing in your ‘Watch later’ youtube playlist, that’s been there for three years, and now you want to know why did you add it in the first place.
