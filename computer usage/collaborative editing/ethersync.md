Very neat idea to create a protocol for collaborative editing to allow users of different editors to work together when pairing.

Has vim and vscode plugins, and there is an open source emacs plugin.

via [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/wd6fhe/ethersync_peer_peer_collaborative), I'd seen it before but hadn't noted it and I'm glad they seem to still be making progress.
