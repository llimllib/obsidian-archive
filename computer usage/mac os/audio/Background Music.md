- pauses your music player when a second audio source starts playing
- provides volume sliders for individual apps
- makes it easy to record system audio
	- (this is what got me interested in it)

> You can record system audio and a microphone together by creating an aggregate device that combines your input device (usually Built-in Input) with the Background Music device. You can create the aggregate device using the Audio MIDI Setup utility under /Applications/Utilities

available on brew: `brew install --cask background-music`
