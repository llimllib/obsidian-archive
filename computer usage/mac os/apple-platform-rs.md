> This repository contains a collection of [[Rust]] crates to support Apple platforms.

> See the various project directories for more.

> The most notable project is `apple-codesign`, which contains a pure Rust (re)implementation of Apple code signing and notarization. This enables you to sign, notarize, and release Apple software without macOS and without Apple hardware.
