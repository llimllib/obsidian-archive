My printer driver came as a mac `.pkg` program that wouldn't install because it was too old. I figured that inside it had the content, probably in PDFs or HTML files, and I wanted to get at it.

Fortunately, I learned that Mac finder has a "show package contents" functionality if you right-click on a `.pkg` file, which will let you pull out individual files.

Inside a second `.pkg` inside the primary `.pkg`, I found the directory full of HTML files that I was looking for and I have no need of the program. Success!
