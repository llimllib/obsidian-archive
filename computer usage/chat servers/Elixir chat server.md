I started hacking on a chat server in elixir, but didn't get very far.

I would like to have one that is dead simple to deploy and uses sqlite for a backend.

The idea would be to build it to support small communities, not to scale to the entire world. I would love to support people supporting their own community with software rather than having to run it all through AppGooFace!
