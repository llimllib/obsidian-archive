I started hacking on a chat server in [[elixir]], but didn't get very far.

I would like to have one that is dead simple to deploy and uses sqlite for a backend.

The idea would be to build it to support small communities, not to scale to the entire world. I would love to support people supporting their own community with software rather than having to run it all through AppGooFace!

I started hacking on a golang version of this at one point.

The big advantage of go over erlang would be that it would just be a binary you could dump on a system, while elixir has a somewhat complicated deploy story
