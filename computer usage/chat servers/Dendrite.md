[Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) is an attempt to build a golang version of a matrix homeserver.

Sadly it does not seem to have gathered enough momentum, or matrix is too complex, for it to become a real competitor. It seems to lag very far behind on features.

On the upside, if you're not federating, it might be easy to run a cheapo chat server with sqlite?
