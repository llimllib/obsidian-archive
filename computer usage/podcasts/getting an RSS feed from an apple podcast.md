This tool has one job, and it does it very well.

> #### How Podcast Lookup works?

> Apple offers a iTunes lookup API that allows you to search for a podcast by its name or by its iTunes ID. The API is public and anyone can use the API without authorization.

> The Lookup API, available at https://itunes.apple.com/lookup, returns the podcast publisher's name, podcast genre, thumbnails and other metadata in addition to the original RSS feed URL.
