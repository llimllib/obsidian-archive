> How it works
> 
> Marker is a pipeline of deep learning models:
> 
> -    Extract text, OCR if necessary (heuristics, surya, tesseract)
> -    Detect page layout and find reading order (surya)
> -    Clean and format each block (heuristics, texify
> -    Combine blocks and postprocess complete text (heuristics, pdf_postprocessor)
> 
> It only uses models where necessary, which improves speed and accuracy.

neat application of machine learning. I've not used it yet, but have had situations in the past where it would have come in handy.
