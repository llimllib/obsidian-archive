> _Painless regular expressions._   `sd` uses regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. Forget about dealing with quirks of `sed` or `awk` - get productive immediately.

> _String-literal mode._   Non-regex find & replace. No more backslashes or remembering which characters are special and need to be escaped.

> _Easy to read, easy to write._   Find & replace expressions are split up, which makes them easy to read and write. No more messing with unclosed and escaped slashes.

> _Smart, common-sense defaults._   Defaults follow common sense and are tailored for typical daily use.
