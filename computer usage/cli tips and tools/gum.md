https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum

A command-line tool for showing nicely-formatted messages or prompts.

Also has many other features; it does fzf-like stuff, can print boxes in fancy formats, and can log messages in structured ways with nicely colored output.

I've mentioned other charmbracelet tools before:
- [[Sequin - debug ANSI escapes]]
- [[source code images for tweeting]]
- [[vhs - gifs of terminal interaction]]
