> _An interactive replacer for `ripgrep`._

> This is an interactive command line tool to make find and replacement easy. It uses [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to find, and then provides you with a simple interface to see the replacements in real-time and conditionally replace matches.

Doesn't appear to be available on homebrew, unfortunately.
