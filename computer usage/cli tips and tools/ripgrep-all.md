> rga is a line-oriented search tool that allows you to look for a regex in a multitude of file types. rga wraps the awesome [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and enables it to search in pdf, docx, sqlite, jpg, movie subtitles (mkv, mp4), etc.

Uses [[ripgrep]] to search many more file types. The sqlite searching is particularly neat to me.

I like the idea, and I'll install the tool, but this type of tool often falls into a bucket where I don't need it often enough to remember that it exists.
