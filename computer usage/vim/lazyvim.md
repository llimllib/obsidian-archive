Seems like a nice place to crib modern config from. For example, [here's their keymaps](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/52b4213ab1344f4be5d6e8cd4513f339b6f9e442/lua/lazyvim/config/keymaps.lua) which can serve as a useful guide for moving keymaps over to lua.

Also shows how to split lua config up in reasonable ways, which I've been too lazy to do.
