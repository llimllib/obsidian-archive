I have used [null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim), then that got archived so I switched to [formatter.nvim](https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim/), but then [none-ls](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim/) came around to keep `null-ls` alive so I switched back to it. It seems snappier and is easier to configure and debug.
