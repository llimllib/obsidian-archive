> A Neovim plugin for writing and navigating an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, written in Lua.

> Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian -- a simple, markdown-based notes app -- but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything else.

> _This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it._ My personal workflow involves writing Obsidian notes in Neovim using this plugin, while viewing and reading them using the Obsidian app. That said, this plugin stands on its own as well. You don't necessarily need to use it alongside the Obsidian app.
