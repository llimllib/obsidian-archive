> Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics editor, available now in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.

Looks like a neat fusion of an illustrator-like tool with procedural code integrated.

Wish I had more of a use for it!
