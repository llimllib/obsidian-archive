I have previously wanted to do regular expression searches over my notes and couldn't figure it out, but of course I didn't actually go and do anything as crazy as [reading the documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search).

You can do a regular expression search just by surrounding it with `//`. i.e., `/\bproxy\b/` which search for the word `proxy` surrounded by word boundaries.
