7 Sep 2023: I added search to obsidian_notes. The implementation is only about [45 lines](https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/blob/a334cab/templates/search.html#L20-L65) of javascript, and the result is [here](https://notes.billmill.org/search.html).

[here's the commit](https://github.com/llimllib/obsidian_notes/commit/a334cab385ab13a4d6f6175c815613fda5eb35de) that introduced it.
