To enter inspect mode and see what's going on, hit option-cmd-I (on a mac)

The theme source is (on my mac) located at: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/personal/.obsidian/themes`

I tried to widen the live preview editor window, but was not successful; it wasn't clear to me where in the CSS for my theme the CSS I was seeing in the inspector was coming from.
