snapshots a web page to a single HTML file. Similar to [[monolith]]. Its author says on news.yc:

> one of the major differences is that monolith doesn't use a web browser to take page captures. As a result, it doesn't support JavaScript, for example. SingleFile, on the other hand, requires a Chromium-based browser to be installed. It should also produce smaller pages and is capable of generating ZIP or self-extracting ZIP files.
