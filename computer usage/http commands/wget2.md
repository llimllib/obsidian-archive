> GNU Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive website downloader.

> Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget, that provides the basic functions needed by a web client.

> Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses many features to allow fast operation.

> In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to HTTP2, HTTP compression, parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header.

I didn't know there was a successor to [[wget]] being worked on.
