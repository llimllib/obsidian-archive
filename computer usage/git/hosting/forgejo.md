A fork of [[gitea]] by [codeberg](https://codeberg.org). Launched after the gitea project created a company, and they want to keep it FOSS. [Reasoning for the fork here](https://blog.codeberg.org/codeberg-launches-forgejo.html)

forgejo is [implementing federation](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/59), which is neat. [article here](https://nlnet.nl/project/Gitea/) and [faq here](https://forgejo.org/2023-01-10-answering-forgejo-federation-questions/). 

It would be cool if it could use [mastodon as its IdP!](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/4800)
