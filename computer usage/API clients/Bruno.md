> Bruno is a new and innovative open source API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman, Insomnia and similar tools out there.  
  
> Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language, Bru, to save information about API requests.  
  
> You can use git or any version control of your choice to collaborate over your API collections.  
  
> Bruno is offline-only. There are no plans to add cloud-sync to Bruno, ever. We value your data privacy and believe it should stay on your device. Read our long-term vision [here](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269).

Now that both Postman and Insomnia seem to have enshittified, this seems like the best API client around
