> _mprocs_ runs multiple commands in parallel and shows output of each command separately.

> When you work on a project you very often need the same list of commands to be running. For example: `webpack serve`, `jest --watch`, `node src/server.js`. With mprocs you can list these command in `mprocs.yaml` and run all of them by running `mprocs`. Then you can switch between outputs of running commands and interact with them.

> It is similar to [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) but _mprocs_ shows output of each command separately and allows to interact with processes (you can even work in _vim_ inside _mprocs_).

Gives you a TUI interface for your processes:

looks neat! I haven't tried it yet.
