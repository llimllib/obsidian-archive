Alternative to gnu parallel written in [[programming/golang/Go]]

> `rush` is a tool similar to [[gnu parallel]] and [gargs](https://github.com/brentp/gargs). `rush` borrows some idea from them and has some unique features, e.g., supporting custom defined variables, resuming multi-line commands, more advanced embedded replacement strings.
