I'd listened to and enjoyed this album earlier this year, but forgot about it until Four Tet played "Birth4000" in [this excellent radio set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjuPalIWNaM).

If you haven't checked out the Lot radio sets on youtube, give them a listen, a lot of them are great!

Floating Points did a wonderful [[boiler room]] set I've linked previously, and a superb album with [Pharoah Sanders](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ShtO5VCYa3ctlR5uzLWBa?si=b3wWPDKKQt-Slo4ioVc6dQ) a few years ago that's very different stylistically than this one.
