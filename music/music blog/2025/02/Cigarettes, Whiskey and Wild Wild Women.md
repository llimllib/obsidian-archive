I woke up this morning with Jim Croce singing "Cigarettes, Whiskey and Wild Wild Women" in my head:

The earliest version I can find of it is by Red Ingle and the Natural Seven, published as "Cigareetes, Whuskey and Wild Wild Women" in 1947. This version is a riot:

Buck Owens covered it in a very similar style:

And there's also a notable cover... by Peter Sellers on the Muppet Show?
