I don't remember how I came to love this album, maybe I had a physical copy that I found at a used cd shop?

But I love it, and have listened to it probably a thousand times. I find it simultaneously stimulating and calming, and the playing masterful without being overbearing.

(But I'm no classical music judge; it just works for me)
