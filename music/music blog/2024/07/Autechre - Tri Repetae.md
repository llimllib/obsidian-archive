An old favorite of mine, one of the first albums that made me interested in bleepy bloopy music.

I got reminded of it by [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/1dcq7mb/rate_announcement_90s_warp_rate/) for rating this album and some other Warp Records classics.

(I have no interest at all in rating this album or rating things in general, but the thread reminded me of some good music I hadn't listened to in a while)
