Derek Gripper is a guitarist who learned to play his guitar almost like it were a kora, the instrument that Ballaké Sissoko is playing with him here.

He has some lovely albums, my favorite is [one night on earth](https://open.spotify.com/album/2HPMHajfzsl1iOwRmZNRla?si=A32a5j1RTVuTMvsYbSkokw).

Ballaké Sissoko also has some excellent albums, my favorite is [chamber music](https://open.spotify.com/album/3X9jyh4EcJSKO1X0mdQkXJ?si=JtSMqCHGQCybSMUGd9cIpg), on which he performs with Vincent Ségal. I previously mentioned them in [[Sissoko, Segal, Parisien & Peirani]] and also mentioned their [[Tiny Desk concerts]] together
