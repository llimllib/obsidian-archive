I woke up yesterday with the song "Fever" stuck in my head. The original version by Little Willie John is an R&B number:

But the version I had in my head, and the most famous, is Peggy Lee's incredibly stripped-down arrangement:

There are many covers, practically all arranged like the Peggy Lee version. Elvis and Madonna both did it.

One cover I found in a quick search is this interesting version by The Cramps:
