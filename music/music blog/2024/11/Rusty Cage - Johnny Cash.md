I went back and listened to Johnny Cash's American Songwriter series last night.

(Towards the end of his career, Johnny Cash produced a series of four "American Songwriter" albums composed of cover songs)

Of course [Hurt](https://open.spotify.com/track/28cnXtME493VX9NOw9cIUh?si=89b1acde32b34689) is the most famous, but Rusty Cage and [I see a Darkness](https://open.spotify.com/track/6duDmFwanTY6zaMS9sTM5h?si=fef31029066049c5) jumped out at me. I love [Bonnie 'Prince' Billy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmFynsUrSz0) original and Will Oldham (aka Billy) sings background on Cash's cover.
