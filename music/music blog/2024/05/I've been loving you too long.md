I didn't know Otis Redding had a live album from the [Monterey Pop Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_International_Pop_Festival), the event that's widely considered to have started the summer of love.

There's an excellent [500 songs episode](https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-151-san-francisco-by-scott-mckenzie/) that gives some context and lots of color for the event.
