McCoy Tyner was a pianist who worked with Coltrane, but I feel like not many people know his other work or even recognize his name.

I think I found out about him by pulling this CD from the bin at the library, having no idea who it was but thinking it looked interesting, and giving it a listen. I found out about a lot of music that way.

He came up on shuffle this morning, and I recommend giving him a listen if you enjoy jazz at all.
