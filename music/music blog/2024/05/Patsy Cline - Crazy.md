When I was a kid, both of my parents worked full-time jobs, and my grandmother filled in the gaps for them - she would drive us around to do chores, to sports games, or all of my friends to the park to play basketball.

I spent a lot of time in the car with my grandmother, and she had exactly one tape in her car through all those years: Patsy Cline's greatest hits.

She would drive super slow, a line of cars forming behind her, propped up on a phone book, jamming to the same tape she always had.

(From a [short mastodon thread](https://hachyderm.io/@llimllib/112099808854834419) I wrote about my Grandma, may she rest in peace. I'm listening to Patsy again this morning)
