A cover of [Bill Doggett's honky tonk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fa2ZKzfIP0), the first instance of a riff you absolutely recognize as foundational to rock and roll.

Maybe go check out the [Buddy Holly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySwneOLEf0) or the [Beach Boys version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq3ZgfcrPRo)?
