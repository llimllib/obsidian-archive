Live at the BBC, 1964

Started listening last night to the podcast [A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs](https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-167-the-weight-by-the-band/#more-1833) with the episode about "The Weight" by the Band. It mentioned that they really liked Cannonball Adderley and his sextet:

> The Hawks really started to find their identity as their own band in 1964. They were already far more interested in playing soul than Hawkins had been, but they were also starting to get into playing soul *jazz*, especially after seeing the Cannonball Adderley Sextet play live:

> [Excerpt: Cannonball Adderley, “This Here”]

> What the group admired about the Adderley group more than anything else was a sense of restraint. Helm was particularly impressed with their drummer, Louie Hayes, and said of him “I got to see some great musicians over the years, and you see somebody like that play and you can tell, y’ know, that the thing not to do is to just get it down on the floor and stomp the hell out of it!”

I realized I hadn't listened to Cannonball Adderley in a while, so here we are.
