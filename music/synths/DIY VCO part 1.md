Lovely video from Moritz Klein on how to build a simple oscillator, and how electricity works.

Watched it with my older kid, he loved it and I think we both learned a bunch. Seems like a big jump from knowing nothing to being able to play with a breadboard, but maybe we could figure it out? The video inspired me to want to try.
